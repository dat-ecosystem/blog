title: Code for Science & Society Expands Board
---

We held our first board meeting in San Francisco last week where we welcomed two new board members and a board advisor. Our board oversees operations and will support us as we develop sustainable strategic vision for Code for Science & Society (CSS) and the Dat Project. 

The role of CSS, a nonprofit, has been two-fold, it has housed Dat leadership and acted as a fiscal sponsor for other projects (learn more at [codeforscience.org](https://codeforscience.org/)). As we formalize the structure of CSS, we will ensure Dat governance is in line with open source best practices and the community's needs. CSS will continue to employ people involved in Dat Project, but new community-rooted processes will govern Dat and bring more transparency to the project. We will communicate more on the process of establishing a new governance model over the coming months. In the meantime, weâ€™d like to introduce our board:
