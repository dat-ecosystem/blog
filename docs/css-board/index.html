      <section class="post-full-content"><p>We held our first board meeting in San Francisco last week where we welcomed two new board members and a board advisor. Our board oversees operations and will support us as we develop sustainable strategic vision for Code for Science &amp; Society (CSS) and the Dat Project.</p>
<p>The role of CSS, a nonprofit, has been two-fold, it has housed Dat leadership and acted as a fiscal sponsor for other projects (learn more at <a href="https://codeforscience.org/">codeforscience.org</a>). As we formalize the structure of CSS, we will ensure Dat governance is in line with open source best practices and the community's needs. CSS will continue to employ people involved in Dat Project, but new community-rooted processes will govern Dat and bring more transparency to the project. We will communicate more on the process of establishing a new governance model over the coming months. In the meantime, weâ€™d like to introduce our board:</p>

<p>Kaitlin Thaney is the Endowment Director of the Wikimedia Foundation and is our new  ðŸŽ‰ Board Chair ðŸŽ‰!!! Her work focuses on long-term sustainability and support for the free and open knowledge movement. Prior to joining Wikimedia, she oversaw the Mozilla Foundation's network of community programs, a $10 million portfolio crossing science, education, Internet of Things, advocacy, and gender-based programming. She also worked to build programs such as the Mozilla Science Lab, Digital Science, early Open Access and Open Data work with Creative Commons, and Datakind UK. Kaitlin was formerly on the Dat project advisory board. Kaitlin was elected to the position of Board Chairperson at our February meeting - we are thrilled to have her at the helm of our board.</p>

She managed the Dat desktop application and DatBase public registry projects. She is an innovative software developer as well as an accomplished writer, public speaker, and activist who works to support an equitable web. Formerly a research scientist at Indiana University, her work studying online political communication resulted in multiple peer-reviewed papers and press in outlets such as NPR and the Wall Street Journal. She has successfully led teams to success with diverse projects throughout her career in academia, non-profits, and industry. Her deep understanding of the technology and experience working on open web issues will bring valuable perspective to the board.</p>
