      "content_html": "<div>\n<p>Keet takes a new approach by creating a chat app which ensures that your calls are secured with end-to-end encryption, sharing data exclusively among participants. With no intermediaries, third-parties, or servers in the mix. Keet's video calls thrive on direct connections between you and other peers, bypassing servers that could impede your performance‚Äîbringing about a noticeable enhancement in your communication experience.</p>\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Let's welcome Mathias!</strong> Mathias is a founder and a core developer behind <a href=\"https://keet.io/\">Keet</a>. He is known for his contributions to the Node.js and JavaScript communities and has been actively involved in the development of <code>peer-to-peer (P2P)</code> technologies, particularly within the context of the <code>Dat</code>.</p>\n<p>His project <code>Keet</code> is a p2p  video &amp; text chat. It  only shares end-to-end encrypted data between the participants in every call. Without middlemen, third-parties, or servers, there‚Äôs nobody left who can snoop on calls, leak or collect data.<br>\nKeet video calls operate over direct connections between users, without using servers that can throttle your performance. You'll notice the difference immediately.</p>\n<p>The demo Mathias shared with us illustrates the straightforward process of getting started with Keet. Users can install the application, join or create chat rooms, and seamlessly engage in secure conversations without the need for extensive setup or registration. The absence of a centralized server ensures a <code>direct and private</code> connection between participants. Overall, Keet presents a promising solution for individuals seeking a straightforward and secure communication platform, embracing the principles of peer-to-peer connectivity.</p>\n<p>Recorded a few months ago, the demo precedes the release of several new features by Keet. It's highly recommended to download the latest version to explore these enhancements.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Mathias mentions an upcoming <code>Holepunch runtime</code>, planned for launch in February, promising exciting opportunities for developers to create apps similar to Keet.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"image\">\n    <img src=\"/content/images/2024/01/demo-keet.svg\" alt=\"Keet logo with dat ecosystem robot\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  <h2>Main takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qiY_zunlJYg?t=29\">00:29</a> The process of installing and joining rooms in Keet is simple</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qiY_zunlJYg?t=65\">01:05</a> Set your profile with your name and information</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qiY_zunlJYg?t=87\">01:27</a> Adding and sharing files using Keet</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qiY_zunlJYg?t=140\">02:20</a> Starting a call and configuring it for notifications</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Discover Keet with Mathias ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 0.5rem;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiY_zunlJYg?si=ZnKjZKVlDnwLBNtD\" title=\"Keet demo session\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div class=\"note\">\n‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Project Status</b> <br/>\nKeet is built on top of a <a href=\"https://holepunch.to/\">Holepunch</a> runtime.

      "content_html": "<div>\nƒÄhau proposes a different take on social apps for many reasons. First of all, it's P2P social. Secondly and most interesting its the direction the app made, focusing on helping tribes maintain their cultural heritage. Its a great example of combining state-of-art tech with a clear social purpose. Continue reading to learn more.\n<br/><br/>\n<p><strong>Let's welcome Mix!</strong> Mix is part of the team behind <a href=\"https://ahau.io/\">ƒÄhau</a>. The startup, has its roots in New Zealand, focusing on helping local communities keep their identities and cultural narratives alive with the help of some P2P tools.</p>\n<p>ƒÄhau is essentially an <code>offline-first</code> data platform. It encourages users to ran their local data servers called PƒÅtaka (useful for data-sync) and it also provides a desktop app, to create and organize tribal cultural info, this is ƒÄhau.<br>\nThe team was aware about the lack of a permanent internet connection for some members. Everyting is editable without requiring an internet connection. When a member is able to connect to their local tribe network, they can sync and update their data.</p>\n<p>In this demo, Mix will be touring us through some different aspects of ƒÄhau desktop client, like managing different tribes and the family graph feature. With it, a family member can not only discover and edit its own family tree, but also can add metadata as <em>stories</em>.<br>\nA <code>story</code> is a collection of media, other family members and text. This way, families and tribes have a way to collect and organize their own cultural &amp; family narratives.</p>\n<p>Mix also mentions some of the onboarding process for a new member. There are two main options at this point. A new member can start their own tribe or can join an existing one, asking for permission to <em>guardian</em> member. Once you are part of a tribe, you can start the syncing process and get all the info about that tribe.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"image\">\n    <img src=\"/content/images/2023/12/demo-ahau.svg\" alt=\"ƒÄhau logo with dat ecosystem robot\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  <h2>Main takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9gwyF3HDGm4?t=53\">00:53</a> ƒÄhau Desktop Intro</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9gwyF3HDGm4?t=120\">02:00</a> Family Tree Feature</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9gwyF3HDGm4?t=182\">03:02</a> Family Stories</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9gwyF3HDGm4?t=305\">05:05</a> Onboarding Process</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9gwyF3HDGm4?t=378\">06:19</a> Joining a New Tribe</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9gwyF3HDGm4?t=460\">07:40</a> Start your Own Tribe</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9gwyF3HDGm4?t=684\">11:31</a> The P2P Side of ƒÄhau</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Discover ƒÄhau with Mix ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 0.5rem;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gwyF3HDGm4?si=-K3zSQOT672LA_w8\" title=\"ƒÄhau demo session\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div class=\"note\">\n‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Project Status</b> <br/>\nƒÄhau is built on top of <a href=\"https://scuttlebutt.nz/\">scuttlebutt</a>.

The main author behind the project. On this session, Hans will introduce us to <code>Dcent Reads</code> (previously known as HyperPubee), a platform to allows writers to publish for free and to have a place to connect directly with readers.<br>\nThe platform works using the hyperswarm network and it can be used (partially) on the web and desktop (full experience).</p>\n<p>One of its main features is that authors can easilly <strong>embed</strong> (and reference) other works. The project is at an early stage and the focus is on the internals at this moment, looking for a solid experience: creating content, embedding and publishing. There is some work left on improving the user experience, though.</p>\n<p>In this demo session, Hans will guide us through the creation process, how to embed content and publish it. It also covers the idea of allowing different media in the future, like <em>music</em> (Dcent Beats!?).

      "content_html": "<div>\nOne of the most fundamental human needs is to communicate. It allows us to organize and lever up communities. In the internet era, chat apps have become a commodity. These kind of apps, are so important to us. We use them daily without even noticing. Most of the time, we are using centralized chat. These apps have become one of the main data collection points, real privacy is never a priority.\nCabal, offers an alternative take. Built upon the hyper-stack and with an offline-first approach --no servers needed. It becomes a very interesting community-based option.\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Cool! A new demo session arrived. This time Alex breaks down <a href=\"https://github.com/cabal-club/cabal-cli\"><code>cabal-cli</code></a>. With an IRC-like aspect, cabal-cli allows us to connect and chat with other friends directly.</p>\n<p>Whilst, Cabal can be tagged as an experimental chat platform, we can not ignore the fact that has been battle-tested since day 1 (around 2018).</p>\n<p>With Cabal you can list, create, archive and join channels. You can also create topics and you can even <strong>moderate</strong> them by sharing a cabal link with an special admin key. This way we are sharing a filtered/protected view of a cabal (eg: filtering out bad actors).<br>\nThese are powerful features for a P2P communication platform and a sign that indicates how the Cabal Community cares about building a safe and secure place.</p>\n<p>In the demo, Alex guides us through the different commands that you can use on Cabal to have a rich communication experience.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"image\">\n    <img src=\"/content/images/2023/10/demo-cabal.svg\" alt=\"cabal logo with dat robot\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  <h2>Main takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0NeCCONtsoM?t=43\">00:43</a> Cabal CLI Intro</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0NeCCONtsoM?t=132\">02:12</a> Name Yourself</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0NeCCONtsoM?t=164\">02:44</a> The Cabal Key üîë</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0NeCCONtsoM?t=197\">03:17</a> The Admin Portion üîë</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0NeCCONtsoM?t=380\">06:20</a> Offline-first Capabilities / Sync History from other peers</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0NeCCONtsoM?t=570\">09:30</a> Moderators and Admins / Layers of Trust</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Discover Cabal with Alex ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 0.5rem;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NeCCONtsoM?si=OlCH0iu7gJJ8OZUq\" title=\"Cabal Demo Session\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div class=\"note\">\n‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Project Status</b> <br/>\nCabal is an ongoing effort since 2018.

      "content_html": "<div>\nLet's unveil the browser for the P2P era with Agregore. With a minimal API surface approach and extentions-oriented, aggregore offers a solid approach to surf the distributed web and create local first apps & sites. Agregore supports hyper, ipfs and bittorent.\nDon't miss the demo to see how easy you can start creating local-first content.\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<p>A new demo session appeared! This time is all about the distributed web. Mauve, a prolific P2P developer will introduce us to creating local-first apps using Agregore browser. This new browser has a small but super capable and flexible API that makes it easy to create local-first content and even apps.</p>\n<p>With agregore you can navigate to <code>hyper://</code> and <code>ipfs://</code> like any other site on the regular web. Every site you visit is locally saved and reshared. This offers 2 direct benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Content resiliency, every site is a local-first site.</li>\n<li>Populates the distributed web.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the demo, Mauve also mentions that agregore is compatible with other publishing tools like <a href=\"https://docs.distributed.press/deployment\">Distributed Press</a>.</p>\n<p>Outside of loading data, agregore offers a way to author data using its own P2P-compatible version of <a href=\"https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/agregore-browser/tree/master/docs\"><code>fetch</code> API</a>. Mauve made something really interesting extending the fetch API functionality. This way we can use a regular POST method to create new content, like a new site, right from the browser üÜí.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://agregore.mauve.moe/docs/\">Their docs</a> are a great entry place to learn more about agregore internals and the fetch API.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"image\">\n    <img src=\"/content/images/2023/10/demo-agregore.svg\" alt=\"agregore logo with dat robot\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  <h2>Main takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtAtgLWzyXU?t=30\">00:30</a> Agregore Intro / Main Interface</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtAtgLWzyXU?t=68\">01:10</a> Agregore can Surf the Distributed Web</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtAtgLWzyXU?t=122\">02:02</a> Local-first Navigation &amp; Resharing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtAtgLWzyXU?t=163\">02:46</a> Using Distributed Press as a Publishing Tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtAtgLWzyXU?t=226\">03:46</a> Interact with the Distributed Web with the P2P Fetch API</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtAtgLWzyXU?t=287\">04:47</a> Creating a new P2P Website</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BtAtgLWzyXU?t=526\">08:46</a> Agregore Extensions and Web Archiving</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Discover Agregore with Mauve ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 0.5rem;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtAtgLWzyXU?si=Mh_TJw7w1ScpSevP\" title=\"Agregore Demo Session\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div class=\"note\">\n‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Project Status</b> <br/>\nAgregore is under active development.

No install required.</p>\n<p>It also covers some of the challenges they faced trying to balance a the user experience of a non-technical user with the complexity that arises in any P2P project. The team always had this in mind, they were creating a P2P platform for general users (creators and their fans).</p>\n<p>They also directed the platform to the LATAM market first. Since most of they was based in Argentina üá¶üá∑ this was almost a natural decision. They were talking with local creators and their fans-base.</p>\n<p>All these things made from Sher a quite unique development experience and product.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"image\">\n    <img src=\"/content/images/2023/09/demo-sher.svg\" alt=\"sher logo and dat robot\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  <h2>Main takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=37\">00:37</a> Platform Intro (sher.app)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=67\">01:07</a> My Shows and &quot;the browser is the user&quot; (private key)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=130\">2:11</a> Streamer View / Edit your show</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=214\">3:36</a> Sher basic economy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=250\">4:10</a> Publish your show and have a friendly name on sher.app</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=299\">4:59</a> Streaming options (ie: add other sources)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=333\">5:33</a> Go live and share your show link</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=378\">6:18</a> Basic stats &amp; help with creators anxiety</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=448\">7:28</a> Invite a friend and stream together</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sMVFW9Rqd38?t=498\">8:18</a> Interact with your audience</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Discover Sher with Diego ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 0.5rem;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMVFW9Rqd38?si=WEvCfMk0GBMPM7xg\" title=\"Sher Demo Session\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div class=\"note\">\n‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Project Status</b> <br/>\nSher is currently paused.

Spaces can be used to organize all your different data units using a simple drag and drop interface. Boards, instead represent a single container that holds some particular data unit.</p>\n<p>In the demo session you will see three different wearable devices sending data to a bento space. James will also show how to filter the metrics and even apply some queries.</p>\n<p>One of the plans James has for the future is the addition of an AI assistant (called <em>BeeBee</em>). The assistant could help us create better queries that extract the most from our data using plain english.</p>\n<p>Finally, all these <code>spaces</code> and <code>boards</code> can be shared with other peers using the hypercore protocol.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"image\">\n    <img src=\"/content/images/2023/09/demo-hop.svg\" alt=\"hop logo and dat robot\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  <h2>Main takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hMf2ui2uVWs?t=20\">00:20</a> BentoBox-DS Intro</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hMf2ui2uVWs?t=50\">00:50</a> BentoBox Boards and Spaces</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hMf2ui2uVWs?t=264\">4:25</a> BeeBee Assistant (conversational interface)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hMf2ui2uVWs?t=418\">6:58</a> Public Boards (shared with peers)</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Discover BentoBox DS and Hop with James ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 0.5rem;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMf2ui2uVWs?si=rHoHLm_92uTH5_go\" title=\"HOP Demo Session\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div class=\"note\">\n‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>Project status</b> <br/>\nBentoBox is going through a layout redesign these days.

This move will allow us to continue spreading the word about the hyper-* stack and other dat-based p2p projects.</p>\n<p>Continue reading to learn more.</p>\n<p><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mehdisepehri?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Mehdi Sepehri</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/birds?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"a-little-context\">A Little Context <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a-little-context\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Around mid 2019, the Dat protocol was renamed to the Hypercore Protocol, i.e: <code>hyper://</code>. This was not only a technical change, but also affected the organizational structure (such as which Github organizations should hold which repositories, and with what responsibilities). Ultimately these changes helped communicate  boundaries and responsibilities: <a href=\"https://hypercore-protocol.org/\">hypercore-protocol.org</a> with (@mafintosh et al) will be in charge of all the core technical decisions.</p>\n<p>Great! But, what about the community? A group of projects within the community moved to create the <code>dat ecosystem</code> as a place to gather, discuss, and share projects built on Hypercore. This movement also spawned the <code>dat consortium</code>.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for more information about this change, it's been written about in <a href=\"https://blog.dat-ecosystem.org/dat-protocol-renamed-hypercore-protocol/\">more detail</a> <a href=\"https://www.geutstudio.com/blog/hello-hyper/\">previously</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"relaunch\">Relaunch <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#relaunch\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The protocol renaming was on one hand the event that set the kickoff for re-organizing the tech governance and the community side of Dat. The Dat ecosystem will grow more projects, organize events, and build interoperability and collaboration between the projects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Dat Ecosystem's vision is to improve the society with decentralized tech</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our mission has always been and will continue to be - to encourage people to experiment and innovate with peer-to-peer technology.</p>\n<p>We would like to return control of digital information to the people. The primary focus of the old Dat was sharing in civic data and research, but Dat ecosystem has grown into something bigger.</p>\n<p>Today‚Äôs hypercore protocol is not only fast and reliable, it‚Äôs focus on a secure, privacy-first model is why it has become a foundational software for building peer-to-peer applications.</p>\n<p>Dat Ecosystem welcomes new projects and individuals that share and want to collaborate on our stated vision. We are here to help, to create a space where we can share ideas and grow the hyper-* decentralized space.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-grant\">The Grant <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-grant\">#</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Thanks to the CS&amp;S grant</strong> and ongoing collaboration, we can continue bootstraping the new Dat Ecosystem - a garden of peer-to-peer projects! This work will include a new website that will help us communicate our mission better, which will link to different projects in the ecosystem and overall present a clear picture of what the hyper ecosystem looks like.</p>\n<p>The grant work also includes archiving unmaintained projects in the Dat sphere. This should help us communicate where contributions from the new people are meaningful, and let people know where they can take their first steps into the hyper-* space.</p>\n<p>All of these tasks have <a href=\"https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/organization/issues/8\">been defined</a> and they are open for the community to contribute and get paid for their time (see the estimated budget for under each task).</p>\n<p>Yes, thanks to the CS&amp;S grant, we've allocated a budget that we can use to pay contributors for their hard work. We know first-hand how hard the difficult economics of Open Source projects can be. That's why we really appreciate the support from CS&amp;S and all our contributors in general.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to have a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/organization/issues/8\">tasks</a> that we've prepared. Some require some amount of prior knowledge of the ecosystem, while others are more decoupled and easy to tackle by new contributors. If you'd like to pick something up, feel free to comment on <a href=\"https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/organization/issues/8\">the corresponding issue</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://discord.gg/fZymdRfctR\">join the conversation</a> on Dat Ecosystem discord.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time,</p>\n<p>‚ô•Ô∏è Dat Consortium.</p>\n<p><em>PS: Many thanks to cblgh and ninabreznik for their awesome editing and proofreading support!</em> ü§ó</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p><small>TL;DR: We have an online conference this year: register <a href=\"https://events.dat.foundation/2020/register/\">here</a>!</small></p>\n<p>July 30th and 31st will be the dates for the first Dat conference, given public circumstances the event will be online. Whilst we will miss the chance to see each others faces, we think this will open up numerous opportunities for others to come by and have a full look at what has been cooking in the Dat Universe recently. Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity! üéâ</p>\n<h2 id=\"idea-%26-motivation\">Idea &amp; Motivation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#idea-%26-motivation\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The idea of having a Full Dat related event has been in the air for quite some time. It was early this year, in one of the Dat Consortium meetings that we actually decided to move forward with it, creating a WG to get the ball rolling. Our first goal was towards having an in person event, we were thinking about different locations, somewhere in Europe was one of the strongest options at that point. As you must know, early 2020 has nothing to do with what actually happened later. A global pandemic situation has forced us to change lots of our expectations. So, we have had to adapt and shift towards an online event. But not just any other event.</p>\n<p>We strongly believe in our community, we know that we tend to work a bit disconnected from each other and that makes it a bit difficult to find this hidden gems, that are well just there but need some help connecting to rest. If we wanted to add some geography analogy, we can say that the Dat ecosystem is like an archipel.</p>\n<p>Knowing this, we delineate two main goals: Do everything in our reach to create the event, create the place, that others, that our ecosystem can occupy and make use of.<br>\nAnd prepare to be interactive. Not only open a CfP just for presentations, but encourage other to present in the format they want. As interactive as we can. You will see that near 50% of our schedule are workshops and open discussions. This is all about peers in the end, isn‚Äôt it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect%3F\">What to Expect? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what-to-expect%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As we mentioned before, the event will be split in two fully packed days, we have almost 20 presentations, divided between, talks, workshops and facilitated discussions. We expect to cover a broad range of topics, from the state of <code>hyper</code>, passing to what is the Dat Universe, showcasing many of the newest and shiniest projects in the Dat Ecosystem and even touching future topics like hypercore protocol in rust.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-format\">The Format <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-format\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To facilitate collaboration we chose <a href=\"https://bigbluebutton.org/\">Big Blue Button</a> <em>(BBB)</em> as a meeting platform. It allows for shared documents, Q&amp;A and gives other controls to the presenter which should be great for the workshops in particular. After signing-up for the conference you will receive a link to join us. For each event the presenters have the option to record it, which we will announce at the beginning of each event. The recorded events will be shared through an online stream <a href=\"https://events.dat.foundation/2020/stream/\">on our website</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-the-details\">All the Details <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#all-the-details\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Enough said, show me the details!</p>\n<center>\n    <table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>üìÖ Dates:</th>\n        <td>July 30 & 31</dd>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>üåê Timezones:</th>\n        <td>The event will be spread through the days, they will start early in the morning  (in EU timezones).<br/>Use our <a href=\"https://events.dat.foundation/assets/2020-schedule.ics\">calendar links</a> to avoid any pain with converting timezones manually.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>‚û§ Event site:</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://events.dat.foundation/2020/\">https://events.dat.foundation/2020/</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>üéü Register:</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://events.dat.foundation/2020/register/\">https://events.dat.foundation/2020/register/</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>üó£ Agenda:</th>\n        <td><a href=\"https://events.dat.foundation/2020/schedule/\">https://events.dat.foundation/2020/schedule/</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>üë• Event WG:</th>\n        <td>Diego, Franz, Santiago & Martin</td>\n    </tr>\n    </table>\n</center>\n___\n<p>That‚Äôs all for now, stay tuned to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dat_protocol\">our networks</a> for more updates closer to the event.

      "content_html": "<p>The &quot;Dat Protocol&quot; has been renamed to the &quot;Hypercore Protocol&quot; and there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/hypercore-protocol\">new organization for governing its tech</a>. The &quot;Dat community&quot; will continue as the collective of teams and projects that have evolved from the original Dat CLI project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#background\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Since 2013, grant funding for research into scientific data sharing use cases drove the design and development of dat. This user research drove the creation of the &quot;dat&quot; command line tool as well as the &quot;dat protocol,&quot; a peer-to-peer protocol for building decentralized applications.</p>\n<p>There are a wide variety of core mission partners that are developing applications that use this protocol, including a web browser for developing peer-to-peer websites (<a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com\">Beaker Browser</a>), a community-based mapping and monitoring application (<a href=\"https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/\">Mapeo</a>), a cooperatively-owned data infrastructure (<a href=\"https://cobox.cloud/\">Cobox</a>), a privacy-oriented chat application (<a href=\"https://cabal.chat/\">Cabal</a>), a decentralized operating system (<a href=\"https://github.com/dxos/\">DxOS</a>), a paid content distribution platform (<a href=\"https://ara.one/\">Ara</a>), an offline-friendly alternative to commercial map providers (<a href=\"https://peermaps.org\">Peermaps</a>), a distributed hosting network (<a href=\"https://playproject.io/datdot-substrate/\">DatDot</a>), an application utilizing the <a href=\"https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/\">p2pcommons</a> for as-you-go research communication (<a href=\"https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop\">Hypergraph</a>) and <a href=\"https://dat.foundation/explore/projects/\">the list goes on</a>.</p>\n<p>The breadth of these applications show the power and flexibility of the protocol for building the next-generation Web.</p>\n<h3 id=\"challenges\">Challenges <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#challenges\">#</a></h3>\n<p>As grant money has become thin over the past few years, the development of the dat commandline tool has been very slow. It has become increasingly difficult to find volunteers and grant funding to maintain the dat commandline tool.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>development of the applications listed above (and others) has become stronger than ever</strong>. As the protocol has matured over the past 3 years, the core maintainers have put in significant effort into ensuring the stability and security of the protocol that directly affects the success of these applications.</p>\n<p>As the commandline tool is no longer a driving force for the development of the protocol, it is becoming increasingly clear that more fine-grained control and modularity is needed. Thus, the core maintainers of the protocol have decided to retire the 'dat' protocol and rename it to reflect it's underlying component called 'hypercore'.</p>\n<p>This change from 'dat protocol' to 'hypercore protocol' largely reflects existing core technologies that the dat protocol was dependent upon, and those technologies will be grouped under a single GitHub organization with it's own decision making process, rather than on a variety of personal accounts.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://hypercore-protocol.org\">Hypercore Protocol</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what's-changing\">What's changing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what's-changing\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There is now a new <a href=\"https://github.com/hypercore-protocol\">Hypercore Protocol GitHub organization</a> comprised of active maintainers, whereas the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject\">Dat Project GitHub organization</a> will continue to house the commandline tool and other higher-level software development toolkits that utilize the hypercore-protocol. There is also a new <a href=\"https://hypercore-protocol.org\">Hypercore Protocol website</a> that contains architectural documentation and specifications.</p>\n<p>Hypercore Protocol is a collection of modules and protocol extensions which can be used together or individually. It includes a connectivity layer (Hyperswarm), a secure append-only log with efficient replication (Hypercore), and a POSIX-compatible filesystem (Hyperdrive).</p>\n<p>Hypercore also includes a new URL scheme, <code>hyper://</code>, for referencing any Hypercore-based data structure. As Hypercores declare their data structure, this URL scheme can be used for a wide variety of use-cases. This URL scheme can improve interoperability among applications by providing flexible and modular access to hypercore directly.</p>\n<p>As a decentralized and open-source protocol, it's important to have an open RFC process for making proposals to update the Hypercore protocol. This process is being developed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/hypercore-protocol\">Hypercore Protocol org</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-future-of-dat\">The future of dat <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-future-of-dat\">#</a></h3>\n<p>&quot;Dat&quot; will continue to exist as a community. It is the collective of projects that have emerged over the years from the original Dat CLI. When we talk about the Dat community, we're often referring to that collective: <a href=\"https://cabal.chat/\">Cabal</a>, <a href=\"https://peermaps.org\">Peermaps</a>, <a href=\"https://cobox.cloud/\">Cobox</a>, <a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com\">Beaker Browser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/\">Mapeo</a>, <a href=\"https://ara.one/\">Ara</a>, and even the Hypercore Protocol.</p>\n<p>The datproject GitHub organization will continue as an open community rather than a guarded open source project. This will allow new maintainers to get started more easily, have impact over the development of the dat commandline tool and the surrounding ecosystem of projects that depend upon the hypercore-protocol, such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/sdk\">software development toolkit</a>.</p>\n<p>The <code>dat</code> commandline tool is a community-run project comprised of volunteers. If you're currently using it as a key part of your organization or business, or are generally interested in participating in its maintenance, please get involved in the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat/\">dat cli repo</a>.</p>\n<p>If you would like to become a part of the community, please feel free to attend the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/comm-comm\">datproject public comm-comm</a> that happens every week!</p>\n<p>There will be some larger website changes to the <a href=\"https://dat.foundation\">https://dat.foundation</a> website to reflect this new shift over the coming month. We will also be depreciating the datprotocol GitHub organization and moving any active repositories to the datproject GitHub organization.</p>\n<p>As inertia is real, it might take some time for people, including users, to adopt 'hypercore protocol' rather than 'dat protocol' in their language as part of technical communication, but our aim is that with time this will become more clear.</p>\n<p>For comments and questions, please feel free to join us in our community chat channel on <a href=\"https://webchat.freenode.net/#dat\">IRC</a> or <a href=\"https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions\">Gitter</a> or on the <a href=\"https://dat.discourse.group/\">discourse forum</a>.</p>\n",

      "title": "Recapping Dat&#39;s Mozilla Open Source Support Award",
      "content_html": "<p>In our application for the Mozilla Open Source Support award, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the last four years, Dat has grown from a data sharing tool to a wider community supporting the Dat Protocol. As we work to broaden our community, we recognize the need to improve onboarding new community members, documentation, and supporting implementations in other languages. We‚Äôve organized a Dat Protocol working group to document the existing specification and support other implementations, but we still need someone to help with wider community engagement. Unfortunately, with our constrained resources focusing on development and maintenance, these crucial needs get left behind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While harder to quantify, we recognize that this work is vital to the future of the Dat Project and for collaborations with groups like Mozilla Common Voice. Investments in documentation and community building make it easy for people to use Dat, to suggest improvements, and get answers to questions. With this milestone, we will support someone to conduct user testing on existing documentation, create an improved user funnel, and identify additional community needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A key goal was to understand the needs of the community around documentation and learning resources. Through this support from Mozilla, we‚Äôve advanced the Dat ecosystem in two foundational ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Documenting the protocol and guiding developers interested in implementing the Dat protocol in other languages.</li>\n<li>A complete overhaul and rebrand of ‚ÄúDat Project‚Äù into ‚ÄúDat Foundation‚Äù including updating and consolidating websites and documentation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In line with our goal to operate transparently, we've published our reports to Mozilla in <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/organization/tree/master/grants/2018-MOSS\">this Github Repo</a> and you can also view the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/organization/issues/1\">reports from individual contributors</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Protocol Documentation</strong></p>\n<p>A key challenge we‚Äôve faced over the five years of developing Dat is prioritizing implementation of the protocol versus standardization. With a small team of developers, much of the balance has been weighed towards implementation. This award was a great opportunity to get people outside of the core Dat developers to evaluate and document the protocol, allowing for people to begin implementations in other languages.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/\">How Dat Works</a> guide is a highlight of the work funded by this MOSS award. Not only does it guide new users through every byte and bit of Dat, we feel like it is a learning resource for developers interested in cryptography, decentralization, and even the internet more broadly and is a prime example of how protocol documentation should be. Read more about the process behind creating How Dat Works in <a href=\"/how-dat-works/\">this blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>We are excited to see new Dat implementations being work on in <a href=\"https://github.com/datrs\">Rust</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/datcxx/\">C++</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/datpy\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/datkt\">Kotlin</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Dat Website Updates</strong></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://dat.foundation/\">new Dat website</a> has launched with the help of the community. Based on the feedback from the community research process, we created a <a href=\"https://dat.discourse.group/t/rebuilding-the-dat-website-proposed-site-map/79\">new website structure</a> to fully encompass all of the touch points Dat community members interacted and learned about Dat. The website includes a CMS, allowing easier contributions, and content development for various skill types. Our docs include a <a href=\"https://docs.dat.foundation/docs/kappa\">new tutorial</a> and we will continue to expand those. This website includes a solid foundation for continued improvements and community contributions.</p>\n<p>Read more in <a href=\"/dat-project-is-now-dat-protocol-foundation/\">this post</a> about the move from ‚ÄúDat Project‚Äù to ‚ÄúDat Foundation‚Äù.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This award was a great reminder of all the work required outside of software development to support a functioning and inclusive community project. We are grateful for Mozilla's support of this work and excited that we've been able to engage our community, improve documentation, and create educational resources for people interested in decentralization more broadly.</p>\n",

At its height, the core team in the Dat Project was 8 people in 2016, with both Sloan foundation and Knight Foundation funding. Most of the fruit of this labor has been producing &quot;lego-like&quot; building blocks that hundreds of community members use every day: in their day jobs, in activism, and in art.</p>\n<p>I've been around since mid 2014, and part of my job has been to manage the budget &amp; funder relationships. I will give you a quick overview of how we've spent the money so far (now represented loosely in back-of-the-napkin calculations for the sake of brevity):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$4k per month</strong> on 1 part-time developer community advocate;</li>\n<li><strong>$2k per month</strong> on fundraising &amp; operations;</li>\n<li>Occasional burst contract spending on tutorials, documentation, and UX/design;</li>\n<li>The rest <strong>(16-40k/month)</strong> on open source software development:\n<ul>\n<li>hypercore</li>\n<li>discovery-swarm</li>\n<li>hyperdrive</li>\n<li>dat cli</li>\n<li>dat-node</li>\n<li>hyperdrive v10/hyperswarm (dat 2.0)</li>\n<li>dat base</li>\n<li>random-access-* ecosystem</li>\n<li>hyperswarm</li>\n<li>dat-desktop (outdated)</li>\n<li>...and dozens of other modules, too many to count! (some deprecated and some still active)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In contrast, for the past year, the budget has ranged from $50,000-$200,000, which has maintained 1-3 core developers focused on user experience and core libraries as well as a part-time program manager/fundraiser position. But much more than that amount of work has gone into the ecosystem overall. Most of that development is happening outside of the Dat non-profit.</p>\n<p>This presents both challenges and opportunities for Dat as it enters into this next phase:</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are more companies, startups, and other funded organizations using Dat, which puts more stress on the developer community lead &amp; core engineers.</li>\n<li>The core developers are paid the same as in the beginning of the project, and the number of these positions has not grown.</li>\n<li>Funded organizations benefit from these core tasks, but currently have no coordinated methods for contributing.</li>\n<li>Grants are becoming harder to come by as the project matures (my theory is that grants are more likely given to early-stage &quot;experimental&quot; or late-stage &quot;mature&quot; projects, not mid-stage).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More funded organizations are using Dat, which means more resources in the community</li>\n<li>More community advocates are available to contribute to tutorials, faqs, and documentation</li>\n<li>More value in the protocol, especially to those who are more risk-averse to adopting new technologies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're excited about making the Dat Foundation more useful to the community. This movement recognizes the power of collective software development and will allow us to push forward module development in new and exciting ways. It will give visibility to the less-noticed and ever-important tasks of documentation, design, and working group facilitation. We hope the Foundation will be a  supportive space for the work we can accomplish together as a community over the next 6 years, as we continue to re-imagine and re-engineer the web.</p>\n<h3 id=\"get-involved!\">Get involved! <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#get-involved!\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If you are an organization or individual that is using Dat and would like to contribute, please email us at hi@dat.foundation.</p>\n<p>Thanks &amp; hope to hear from you soon,<br>\nDat Protocol Foundation<br>\nhi@dat.foundation</p>\n",

      "title": "Getting Dat to work in new environments",
      "content_html": "<p><strong>A look at some of the work I've been doing for Dat</strong></p>\n<p>Dat is an awesome mashup of a bunch of useful modules, for <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/discovery-swarm\">peer discovery</a> and for <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdrive\">data replication</a>, that work together to enable people to share data and build distributed websites and applications.</p>\n<p>Current implementations focus on Node.js-based applications, or are being abstracted away with high level APIs in the <a href=\"http://beakerbrowser.com/\">Beaker Browser</a>. What I worked on as part of the <a href=\"/handshake-funding-brings-in-new-developers-for-dat/\">handshake funding</a> was to explore getting these modules to work in new environments outside of Node, namely on mobile devices with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a>, updating the tooling for Dat apps in the non-distributed web, and adding a standard service for storing Dats to the CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobile-apps\">Mobile Apps <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#mobile-apps\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Since I first tried out Beaker, I've been thinking &quot;Wouldn't it be cool if I could do the same thing on my phone&quot;. Some prior work in this direct was the <a href=\"https://github.com/bunsenbrowser/bunsen/\">Bunsen Browser</a> but it wasn't finished, and I wanted to take a stab at doing something similar with <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve/datmobile\">Datmobile</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-node-modules-in-react-native\">Using Node Modules In React native <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#using-node-modules-in-react-native\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I've worked with React native before, and thought that it would give good performance gains over Cordova for the UI and that the native module ecosystem could get me pretty far towards getting Hyperdrive and Discovery-Swarm to work.</p>\n<p>Of course, React Native isn't Node, and it can be fairly daunting to try to get something working when the compiler gives you dozens of warnings about missing dependencies and <code>undefined</code> globals. At first I tried to manually add missing dependencies and define missing globals, but it was hard to get dependencies to accept my changes due to the way React Native's build tools work. Luckily, I was pointed to <a href=\"https://github.com/tradle/rn-nodeify\">rn-nodeify</a> which automatically does most of the work needed, and I then got to focus on getting the rest of the app together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-something-out-there\">Getting Something Out There <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#getting-something-out-there\">#</a></h3>\n<p>After figuring out how to get Hyperdrive to compile, I then started looking into getting a minimal viable product using it. I had recently worked on an <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-js-example/\">example app</a> that used dat-js to browse archives on the web, and I decided to take a similar approach for Datmobile.</p>\n<p>Instead of getting Dat's discovery mechanisms to work in React Native, I reused the Websocket replication from <a href=\"https://github.com/garbados/dat-gateway/\">dat-gateway</a> and implemented some simple screens for viewing folders and files in the archive. An important thing to note is that this version didn't work offline and merely loaded stuff in memory from the gateway.</p>\n<p>I polished up the file views, and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datmobile\">published it on Google Play</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"p2p-networking-%26-persistence\">P2P Networking &amp; Persistence <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#p2p-networking-%26-persistence\">#</a></h3>\n<p>After testing out the initial version, I started looking into discovery-swarm and for a way to persist data to the device so it could be used offline. Just to recap, discovery-swarm consists of three main parts: The <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bittorrent-dht\">BitTorrent-based DHT</a>, the <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/dns-discovery\">DNS trackers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/multicast-dns\">Multicast DNS for local peer discovery</a>. After <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve/datmobile/blob/master/shim.js#L53\">monkey-patching</a> some of the react-native libraries that rn-nodeify added, I got P2P discovery working through the BitTorrent DHT, but MDNS and DNS discovery will need some more tinkering. Plus, the performance of the DHT isn't too great, likely due to the number of false positives in the DHT and the overall performance of the <a href=\"https://github.com/tradle/react-native-udp\">react-native-udp</a> module. But... it works!</p>\n<p>Regarding persistence, and some help with setting up testing from (@lachenmayer)[<a href=\"https://github.com/lachenmayer/\">https://github.com/lachenmayer/</a>] , I created <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve/random-access-rn-file\">random-access-rn-file</a> which could be plugged into hyperdrive to persist the state. Sadly, the <a href=\"https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/\">FS API that it's using</a> does several layers of encoding and decoding from <code>JS -&gt; Base64 -&gt; RN Bridge -&gt; Base64 -&gt; Java</code>. <a href=\"https://github.com/allain/\">@Allain</a> has been looking into alternatives which could give us performance gains. It works, but it adds a lot of latency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"making-a-browser\">Making A Browser <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#making-a-browser\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The last step that was missing was getting the dat content to loading in an actual web view and providing the relevant <a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat\">JS APIs</a>. The hardest part of this was registering a new <code>dat://</code> protocol handler so that images and <code>fetch()</code> requests would automatically invoke the JS code to load content. Neither React Native, nor Android provide a simple API to do this. The closest thing you can do on Android is to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#shouldInterceptRequest(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest)\">intercept all requests</a> and generate entire responses synchronously. I initially attempted to implement a streaming response system, but a bug in the C++ code in Android that interacts with this method means that it will only attempt to read from the request once, and subsequent requests will hang. Then, I saw that somebody was already working on adding support for this feature <a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview/pull/209\">in the react-community-webivew repo</a>. I forked the repo and fixed it up so that I could add support for the Dat protocol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-wasn't-good-enough\">Performance Wasn't Good Enough <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#performance-wasn't-good-enough\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Sadly, I had to put my Datmobile work on hold without finishing up the WebView integration. The performance was just too slow to release. Requests would get intercepted by the webview, but it would take seconds to load anything and the request would time out. I'll need to work on getting DNS discovery to work and to improve FS performance, and then come back to see if it's usable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-on-the-web\">Dat On The Web <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-on-the-web\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Before I got into working on Datmobile, I had done some initial work on <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat-js#readme\">dat-js</a> in order to improve it's performance, and help it load dats from the P2P network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"p2p-in-the-browser\">P2P In The Browser <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#p2p-in-the-browser\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Initially, Dat-JS was using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/webrtc-swarm\">webrtc-swarm</a> in order to create archives in the browser, and share them with other browsers using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API\">WebRTC</a>. It uses a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalhub\">signalling server</a> to find peers, and automatically establishes P2P connections directly between the browsers. With this in place you could use Dat in web applications, but it was limited to Dats that were created within the browser network and it couldn't load Dats created in the CLI or Beaker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gateways-and-websockets\">Gateways And Websockets <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#gateways-and-websockets\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A while ago, I had been playing around with getting Beaker's <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-archive-web\">DatArchive API</a> to work in the web, and part of that was to get a way to connect a Dat in the browser, to the rest of the network using Websockets. I used the Webosocket replication support in <a href=\"https://github.com/garbados/dat-gateway/\">dat-gateway</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/garbados/\">@garbados</a>. The way it works is it listens for incoming websocket connections, gets the Dat read key from the URL, loads the Dat archive for the key in the gateway, and replicates it through the websocket to the browser. After adding this functionality to Dat JS, it was now possible to load <em>any</em> Dat in the browser, and create Dats in the browser that could be loaded in Beaker or the CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"persisting-data-in-the-browser\">Persisting Data In The Browser <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#persisting-data-in-the-browser\">#</a></h3>\n<p>By default, Dat-JS loads archive data in memory, and all of that data gets cleared if you refresh your page. So when you create an archive in the browser, your private keys would get cleared and you'd lose the ability to update it. You'd also be unable to use the data while offline. To solve this, you need to provide a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-access-storage\">storage layer</a> which would persist the data.</p>\n<p>I had mostly used <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-access-idb\">an IndexedDB based</a> storage layer in the past, but even though it had great browser support, it ended up slowing things down significantly. There were alternatives that I knew about, one that used experimental <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-access-chrome-file\">Chrome</a> APIs, and one that used experimental <a href=\"random-access-idb-mutable-file\">Firefox</a> APIs. There was a definite need from <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/discussions/issues/86\">the community</a> to have a storage layer that &quot;just worked&quot; and would use the best storage layer without developers having to do feature detection. With that in mind, I created <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-access-web\">random-access-web</a> which did exactly that. Now it should be easy for people making applications to persist their data in browsers and know that it'll have decent performance on modern browsers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supporting-more-data-structures\">Supporting More Data Structures <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#supporting-more-data-structures\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A potential downside of the dat-gateway approach was that it worked by having the gateway sync data with the network first, which meant the gateway had access to potentially private data. Plus, the gateway was only able to handle Dat archives using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdrive\">Hyperdrive</a> and wouldn't work for projects that wanted to experiment with other data structures like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdb\">HyperDB</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/kappa-db/kappa-core\">Kappa-Core</a>.</p>\n<p>Ideally we'd want to have a gateway that acted as a proxy for Dat's peer discovery mechanism without revealing the actual data to it. That proxy is <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/discovery-swarm-stream\">discovery-swarm-stream</a>. It works by having a browser open up a websocket connection and sending discovery keys for resources that it's interested in. The proxy will then search for peers in the P2P network, open connections to them, and proxy those connections to the client over the websocket. The client's interface looks almost exactly the same as the Node.js API, so people can reuse a lot of their Node.js code in the browser by pairing this with <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\">Browserify</a>.</p>\n<p>After making sure that discovery-swarm-stream worked, I paired it with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@geut/discovery-swarm-webrtc\">discovery-swarm-webrtc</a> into <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve/discovery-swarm-web\">discovery-swarm-web</a> which tries to find peers using WebRTC first, and then uses discovery-swarm-stream to bridge to the rest of the Dat network. The library has a default gateway and signaling server configured for it, but it will attempt to use a local gateway if one exists.</p>\n<p>After testing this stuff out, I can sat that Dat-js feels a lot faster, and it's easier to ensure data will be saved locally without having to think about storage mechanisms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-store\"><code>dat store</code> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-store\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A big challenge in P2P systems is that you need at least one peer to be reachable with some content in oder for new peers to get access to it. In short, if nobody is online with a copy of your Dat, nobody new can download it.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, people needed to use some sort of server that would always be online so that you could tell it to have a copy of your Dat loaded at all times in case your personal computer isn't reachable.</p>\n<p>This mostly came in the form of <a href=\"http://hashbase.io/\">Hashbase</a>, a service hosted by <a href=\"https://bluelinklabs.com/\">Blue Link Labs</a> (Makers of Beaker), and some smaller self-hosted alternatives like <a href=\"https://github.com/beakerbrowser/homebase/\">homebase</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercored/\">hypercored</a>.</p>\n<p>In early 2018, a new <a href=\"https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs/blob/master/proposals/0003-http-pinning-service-api.md\">Dat Enhancement Proposal (DEP 0003)</a> was made which would standardise how people would interact with such services, but sadly it didn't get adopted by the CLI or any other hosting services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"putting-it-together\">Putting It Together <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#putting-it-together\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With that in mind, I needed to get something into the Dat CLI which would: 1. let us interact with storage providers like Hashbase, and 2. make it easy for people to set up a basic storage provider from the CLI. Luckily there were a bunch of high level modules that I could combine to get what I needed. To interact with servers implementing DEP 0003, there is <a href=\"https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dat-pinning-service-client\">dat-pinning-service-client</a> that handles all the handshaking. To manage a set of Dats, I used <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dat-librarian\">dat-librarian</a>. For the HTTP API for the daemon, I used <a href=\"https://www.fastify.io/\">fastify</a>, and for good measure added <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve/discovery-swarm-web\">discovery-swarm-web</a> to it. And to install the storage provider as a service across different operating systems, I used <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/os-service\">os-service</a> which has a tiny API which handles everything that's needed to work on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.</p>\n<p>With all of these parts together, and some <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/1081#issuecomment-479059178\">bikeshedding about the name on IRC</a>, I released <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/dat-store\">dat-store</a> and integrated it as an extension to the Dat CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-the-cli\">Using The CLI <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#using-the-cli\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Now, if you want to add a Dat to Hashbase from the CLI, you can do the following:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g dat dat-store\n\ndat store set-provider https://hashbase.io\n\ndat store login YOUR_HASHBASE_USERNAME\n\ndat store dat://datproject.org\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to run your own store, you can do so without needing to muck around with setting up services on your OS.</p>\n<pre><code>dat store install-service\n\ndat store dat://datproject.org\n</code></pre>\n<p>What's cool is that if you have a Dat Store installed on your machine, it will enable apps using <code>discovery-swarm-web</code> to talk to it directly instead of reaching out to the public gateway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"different-data-structures\">Different data structures <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#different-data-structures\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Now that we have an easy way to share regular Dats, I'd like to go further and figure out what we can do to create a DEP that would allow the store to interact with different Dat data structures like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdb\">HyperDB</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kappa-db/kappa-core\">Kappa-Core</a>, and anything else the community will come up with. Ideally, all Dat stores should support any type of data structure so that application developers can think more about their application, and users can have more choice about how they want to back up their content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what's-next\">What's next <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what's-next\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Now that Dat-JS has been updated with the new libraries, I'm hoping to see projects in the community try to adopt it so that we can make Web apps that work not only in Beaker and Electron, but in legacy web browsers used by people that haven't bought into P2P yet.</p>\n<p>Regarding Datmobile, it's not a primary focus for me at the moment, but I want to fix up the Webview support before <a href=\"https://blog.archive.org/2019/03/24/coming-this-summer-the-first-dweb-camp/\">DWeb Camp 2019</a> in July so that people can author content on their phones and share it on the mesh network.</p>\n<p>I'd also like to improve the documentation for using the Dat CLI, as well as improving the usability of <code>dat store</code>.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Hi, I'm Darius Kazemi and I'm Code for Science &amp; Society's <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/08/21/mozilla-announces-25-new-fellows-in-openness-science-and-tech-policy/\">Mozilla Fellow</a>. I'm halfway through my fellowship and we thought now would be a good time for me to share some of the things that I've been researching, building, and planning.</p>\n<p>I knew coming into this fellowship that I wanted my work to be about the decentralized web as a whole, and not just Dat. CS&amp;S was totally receptive to that and so I've been spending time learning about Dat, but also about <a href=\"https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/\">Secure ScuttleButt</a> and <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\">ActivityPub</a>.</p>\n<p>If what we broadly want is for power to be redistributed from the hands of large centralized corporate interests and back into the hands of individual people and small groups, then we already have the technical protocols to do this. No one protocol will enable this shift in power; each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses. What is needed is software that utilizes these protocols for their strengths, which is to say what is needed is developers and designers who are willing to act as bridges between the communities of practice surrounding the protocols.</p>\n<h2 id=\"complementary-protocols%2C-working-together\">Complementary protocols, working together <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#complementary-protocols%2C-working-together\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I recently attended ScuttleCamp outside of Wellington, New Zealand. A bunch of Secure ScuttleButt community members met up in order to talk about what works and what doesn't with SSB, and where the community would like it to go in the future. It was a great event that I would estimate consisted of equal parts core SSB project team, active users of SSB, and interested outsiders (like me). It was in &quot;unconference&quot; format, so the attendees came up with the schedule on the fly. I was pleasantly surprised to see two Dat sessions pop up, including one on &quot;Bridging Dat and SSB&quot;. There seemed to be a lot of understanding from the SSB team and even users that SSB has its strengths and weaknesses, and it would make sense to use multiple decentralized/distributed protocols to provide great, useful, people-powered software.</p>\n<p>In addition to working with and meeting people from the Dat and SSB community, I've been <a href=\"https://github.com/dariusk/express-activitypub\">developing</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/dariusk/rss-to-activitypub/\">software</a> that uses ActivityPub. ActivityPub is yet another protocol that tries to reduce our reliance on tech giants to do the kind of things we want to do with the internet. I <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/decentralizing-social-interactions-with-activitypub/\">wrote an introduction to ActivityPub for the Mozilla Hacks blog</a> that might be a helpful read.</p>\n<p>In the course of learning about these three protocols and being inspired by conversations with the people that use them, I've come to see them as fulfilling different, complementary roles.</p>\n<p>I'll try and sketch them out here <em>extremely</em> briefly and broadly, and conclude with my thoughts on how we can design better software by bridging these technologies. (I know there are more technologies out there than these three, but these are the three that I know best.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"dat\">Dat <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If you're reading this blog, chances are you already know about Dat. Dat was invented to allow researchers to share very large data sets with each other. It's a protocol that powers software like <a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com/\">Beaker Browser</a>, a web browser that lets you create and publish your own websites without needing a web hosting service.</p>\n<p>My basic bullet points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peer to peer protocol, can share data via your laptop or phone without connecting to some company's server, no out-of-the-box web browser support</li>\n<li>All your content is its own hidden island until its URL is sent to someone else; that person can share the URL or even post it somewhere public and now your island is on the map</li>\n<li>Good for sharing large files, your friends can consent to re-sharing them if they want</li>\n<li>Sends blobs of unstructured data around (you can add your own structure)</li>\n<li>Discovering new stuff requires manually sharing links</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"secure-scuttlebutt\">Secure ScuttleButt <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#secure-scuttlebutt\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Secure ScuttleButt (SSB) was invented, at least in part, to remove distinctions between frontend and backend software, enabling the &quot;backend&quot; to be carried around by a user, who then owns their own data. SSB is a protocol that, like Dat, powers <a href=\"https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/applications\">a bunch of different decentralized applications</a>. Chief among them is <a href=\"https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/getting-started\">Patchwork</a>, which is a kind of decentralized forum software that lets people have and follow conversations about different topics. SSB is also used for things like <a href=\"https://github.com/Happy0/ssb-chess-mithril/blob/master/README.md\">decentralized chess</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/noffle/git-ssb-intro\">decentralized GitHub-style code collaboration</a>.</p>\n<p>My basic bullet points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peer to peer protocol, can share data via your laptop or phone without connecting to some company's server, no out-of-the-box web browser support</li>\n<li>Automatic publication of content to your friends</li>\n<li>Bad for sharing large files; among other things you don't want to force all your friends to store all your large files</li>\n<li>Sends blobs of unstructured data around (you can add your own structure)</li>\n<li>Discovering new stuff is somewhat automatic; once you are initially connected to a network then you can find friends-of-friends and keep connecting to more people</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"activitypub\">ActivityPub <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#activitypub\">#</a></h3>\n<p>ActivityPub was designed to solve the problem of &quot;walled gardens&quot; on the internet by providing a common language for websites and apps to speak to each other. Quoting <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/decentralizing-social-interactions-with-activitypub/\">my previous writing on the topic</a>, ActivityPub is a protocol that &quot;enables a decentralized social web, where a network of servers interact with each other on behalf of individual users/clients, very much like email operates at a macro level.&quot; It enables Twitter-style services like <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org\">Mastodon</a> to talk to Instagram-style services like <a href=\"https://pixelfed.social/\">PixelFed</a> and YouTube-style services like <a href=\"https://joinpeertube.org/en/\">PeerTube</a>. (Brief nerd note: I am referring to the server-to-server portion of the protocol here.)</p>\n<p>My basic bullet points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web protocol, so it works in all desktop and mobile web browsers without special software</li>\n<li>Not peer to peer, relies on special network nodes (servers) and an expert class of systems administrators to operate</li>\n<li>Since content is &quot;federated&quot; (replicated) between known servers, large files can fill up server hard drives pretty fast</li>\n<li>Designed around sending highly structured data</li>\n<li>Discovering new stuff can be pretty easy, it's not too different from existing centralized services that way</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-this-means\">What this means <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what-this-means\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I've started thinking of these three protocols as each solving certain problems in the universe of software design, and when we understand where the protocols fit into the design space, we can start to think of solutions to seemingly intractable problems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dat is great for sharing big files (or bundles of small files).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secure ScuttleButt is great for spreading messages organically between connected networks of people or computers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ActivityPub is great for coordinating messages between networks of always-on servers that are actively maintained by specialist systems administrators.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the software this way gives us a framework to design complex decentralized services.</p>\n<p>For example: how can we have a Google Drive style system where a bunch of people can just connect to each other's computers and share files that way, removing the giant tech company in the middle? Maybe we serve the files over Dat, we have a small network of always-on Dat pinning servers that coordinate with each other over ActivityPub to share file serving responsibilities, and perhaps discovery of what files my friends have been posting happens over Secure ScuttleButt. Maybe every pinning server is also a SSB pub, and <em>these</em> coordinate over ActivityPub so there is robust delivery of social data to every user too. That's a very rough example and of course there are lots of problems that would need to be solved but it gives us a starting point for thinking about how to make this thing happen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#conclusion\">#</a></h2>\n<p>All of this points to two major recommendations that I can make.</p>\n<p>First, that software developers should not be afraid to mix, match, and layer protocols. There is no rule that says you can't do this, yet I've noticed people picking one protocol and sticking to it out of some kind of loyalty. When really, as a developer, your loyalty should be to your values of an open, decentralized internet, whatever those are. If we view these protocols as tools in a toolbox rather than monolithic solutions or ecosystems, we can build decentralized software that rivals and surpasses in utility anything the big centralized tech giants have to offer.</p>\n<p>Second, communities that build and support these protocols need to keep their specific strengths and weaknesses in mind. Instead of trying to make a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; protocol that solves a wide variety of problems, we should acknowledge the limitations of our protocols (and our own resources) and instead support and foster interoperability and collaboration between our communities.</p>\n<p>The internet has always been built on a bunch of different technologies filling in the gaps for each other. For example, while web browsers mainly use the TCP protocol for loading web pages, they switch to using UDP when it's convenient for things like video chat. Decentralized web protocols should be no exception to this pattern. The only way we're going to make the internet better is by working together to help each other.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Joe Hand and <a href=\"http://eight45.net/\">noffle</a> for feedback, and to <a href=\"https://coolguy.website/\">Zach Mandeville</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cameralibre.cc/\">Sam Muirhead</a> for getting me thinking about this in the first place.</em></p>\n",

It has grown so much that most of the people using Dat probably don‚Äôt know about all the things happening. The <a href=\"https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions\">Dat chat</a> can be very noisy. You might have a hard time catching up actually.</p>\n<p><em>Comm-comm</em> was started by the independents Diego and Martin ‚àí without any guidance at all ‚àí as a means to connect people working on Dat and keep them on the same page. <em>CS&amp;S</em> does put some effort into Dat but there are limits. To outgrow those limits of <em>CS&amp;S</em> together, we felt the need for a place where the individuals could join world-wide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúAll the Dat development happens in timezone where I (in Japan) usually sleep. If joining the Dat community is really stressful to me, then it also must be for others.

Communication was the only aspect to be left behind in the evolving process of the fundamental blocks. For example, there are many cool modules &amp; projects that you can use which are somehow hidden on GitHub.

Consequently the hosting style is probably a bit different - which is okay: They take that hour and try to delve into each attendees‚Äô current issue a little bit. Look at some code and most importantly try to figure out a common lingo around this distributed Dat-world and where this could go from here.</p>\n<p><em>(Side-note: the use of words - nomenclature - is right now being discussed in <a href=\"https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs/pull/5\">github:datprotocol/DEPs#5</a>!

In fact, thanks to one of the hosts, Martin Heidegger, it is now easier to make an announcement in the next <em>comm-comm</em>.</p>\n<p>Whether you have been working on a project using Dat, or made some cool module that others can make use of too, share it with us!

At the current Dat project state the <em>comm-comm</em> group can help by collecting common requirements. Eg: if some individual or company joins a <em>comm-comm</em> meeting we can listen to how they are using Dat and the blockers they found and how they have solved them. Using this information we can suggest common pain points or areas of collective collaboration between companies and the Dat project core team.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve our communication</strong>. In the past one could say that talking about Dat was left to only a niche group of specialists. Now this is not true anymore but that does not mean that there is no room for improvement. It is well known that every healthy community needs super good documentation. Also, Dat <em>comm-comm</em> meetings are a great place to help outsiders keep track of recent changes, new modules, new projects built with Dat and everything in between. You just need to join into one of the weekly meetings!</li>\n<li><strong>We want to be friendly</strong> with non-tech people and with developers building things on top of Dat. We are aware of the different needs these two groups have but we hope you can consider Dat <em>comm-comm</em> meetings as good entry points where you can come and ask some questions, share your ideas, announce a new thing or just listen to the conversation; but, please!

The result will be a new experimental app, a mix between two kingdoms. When you combine something like this (at first two different worlds into one) the result does not mean to be the sum of all the benefits or even cons: a complete new thing. Based on this, what can you expect from a web app combined with Dat? You can <a href=\"https://caracara.hashbase.io/\">see it</a> for yourself.</p>\n<p>In particular, when we say web app we are talking about PWAs where offline support is something that comes first and although it is not a key feature, it is common in the decentralized world. The addition of Dat plays a part in the efficient spreading of the content among peers.</p>\n<p>All in all, we at <a href=\"https://github.com/geut\">GEUT</a> believe that it is worth the effort of exploring these combinations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start\">Start <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#start\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Remember, our goal is to create a simple collaborative text editor. This means, peer <strong>A</strong> writes some text, shares the copy with other peer, call it <strong>B</strong>, automatically authorizing <strong>B</strong> to be a new writer.</p>\n<p>OK, let's start with the bootstrap of our web app. We are going to be using <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> for this matter.

We are going to add a new module called <a href=\"https://github.com/geut/saga\"><code>@geut/saga</code></a>. This will give P2P &quot;powers&quot; to our app. ‚ú®</p>\n<h2 id=\"saga\">Saga <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#saga\">#</a></h2>\n<p><code>Saga</code> is a helper module developed by GEUT, that you can use to easily share operations between peers. You can think about this, like <em>applications chatting each other</em>. On top of this, we can do whatever we want with the operations. In this case, the meaning of the operation will be to <em>regenerate</em> the document history in every peer. Since <code>saga</code> will help us to establish a connection and exchange messages with other peers we need to see how it works.</p>\n<p>First, install the dependencies:</p>\n<p><code>npm install @geut/saga @geut/discovery-swarm-webrtc</code></p>\n<p>Now we need to create a connection, this will allow us to talk with a <em>swarm</em> of peers:</p>\n<p>This is an extract of <a href=\"src/p2p/swarm.js\">swarm.js</a></p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// saga requires:</span><br><span class=\"token comment\">//   - a [random-access-storage](https://github.com/random-access-storage) compatible module</span><br><span class=\"token comment\">//   - a public key</span><br><span class=\"token comment\">//   - and something that \"identifies\" the new Dat document</span><br><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> saga <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">Saga</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ram<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> publicKey<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> username<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br><br><span class=\"token comment\">// The initialization of saga is async.

operations. In our case, operations are <code>Automerge</code> changes. As soon as an operation arrives, we apply it. (There is a special case which is the  document creation, that's why we use <code>Automerge.init()</code>, instead of the previous state: <code>this.doc</code>)</p>\n<p>Next, we have the <code>updatePeerValue</code> function. For the sake of simplicity we are not using anything extra to maintain state. So, we will be passing down this function to our child component: the Editor. The Editor maintains a simple textarea component, as you can imagine when the textarea changes, that will trigger our <code>updatePeerValue</code> function.</p>\n<p>We will use two important libraries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/automerge/automerge\">Automerge</a> will handle document transformations. It will give us changes that we can apply later. Automerge helps us maintain a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type\">CRDT</a> data structure, this is super useful when doing collaborative work. üÜí</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch\">diff-match-patch</a> is an excellent library from Google that we are going to use to differentiate the type of changes between previous and current text state. This in conjunction with Automerge creates a pretty solid strategy for handling and distributing changes without conflicts over a network, a decentralized one in our case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let's go

It is good to know this from the very beginning. We need to use some signaling servers to bootstrap the discovery of peers. From that point onwards, the communication is among peers. Another <em>centralized</em> moment is the first download of the app. This can be a github page, a CDN or whatever you want to use. Again, if the app works as a PWA with offline support, additional downloads will not be necessary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#conclusions\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We have just dealt with the development of a <strong>Dat powered web app</strong>. Let's summarize the important parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install and instantiate <code>saga</code>. This is a top level interface on top of <code>hyperdb</code>.</li>\n<li>Create the swarm. This is useful to find another peers. Since we are creating a webapp we will be relying on WebRTC for peer to peer communication. A signal server will be required then. You can host your own if you want to. This is <a href=\"https://github.com/soyuka/signalhubws\">the one</a> we recommend these days.</li>\n<li>After <code>saga</code> instantiation and swarm creation, we can start playing with our app. :tada:\n<ol>\n<li>Since we were after a collaborative editor, two modules appear as a good choice here: <code>Automerge</code> and <code>diff-match-patch</code>.</li>\n<li>We will share operations that we get from <a href=\"https://github.com/automerge/automerge#sending-and-receiving-changes\">Automerge</a> changes.</li>\n<li><code>diff-match-patch</code> is used to extract <code>deltas</code> from plain text.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>That's all! üëç</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see, thinking about sharing operations among peers opens the possibilities for new kind of applications and also makes things a bit easier. Looks like a win-win situation.</p>\n<p>I hope this article helps you to start thinking on new possibilities and give it a try to use Dat on the web!</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks!</strong> ü¶Ö</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#acknowledgments\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I want to say <strong>thanks</strong> to the whole <strong>GEUT Team</strong> for their time and support.

      "content_html": "<p>Let's make it easier to contribute to open source</p>\n<p>This year, Dat received <a href=\"/dat-receives-two-new-grants/\">$100,000 from Handshake</a>, which we plan to use on compensating individuals who have already been active in the community -- or in other words, those who have already volunteered their free time to the project. We believe the distributed web will be best built from the ground up, from a wide variety of voices that just want to see the web flourish without centralized control. This requires a ton of volunteers.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, Dat has been funded largely by grants and donations. This keeps Dat independent and focused on its core mission: making a great distributed data sharing protocol. After some project grants wrapped up in 2017, Dat went through a period of reduced funding. Since then, new developments have largely been volunteer-driven for the past couple of years. Although the underlying technology has been stable, there are still many extensions, features, and tools that are being published daily. These people sometimes find ways to fund themselves, whether through 20% time at their organization, getting an individual grant, or convincing their organization/lab/institute/company that dat is what they need.</p>\n<p>There will always, though, be core work that gets left behind. This work largely cannot be funded by traditional means. Maintenance, usability, and documentation -- the work that gets new volunteer developers able to get involved and excited to contribute -- is often the work that no one wants to fund.</p>\n<p>This is why for this round of unrestricted funding, we (<a href=\"https://datproject.org/about/\">the Dat governance team</a>) want to spend the money on folks who have already been contributing, who have asked for funding, and who are interested in improving onboarding for new users and contributors to the Dat ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Our first short-term grant goes out to <a href=\"https://github.com/RangerMauve\">RangerMauve</a>, who will be working on improving Dat ecosystem libraries for both file archives and append only log databases to work in applications closer to the user: in mobile and the browser. You can keep track of what RangerMauve is working on by watching their GitHub profile over the next few months -- everything contributed will be open source.</p>\n<p>We're very excited to have a new (small) influx of money to give folks who have been until now donating their time to the project, who care about it's success, and want to make it easier for everyone to contribute to it's usability.</p>\n<p>We are really looking forward to announcing new ways that contributors can get money for volunteering or for running their own local dat meetups. Feel free to get in touch with Karissa (okdistribute in IRC) if you'd like to talk about this.</p>\n<p>Volunteering on Dat can be as simple as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Answering questions in public chat channels like <a href=\"https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions\">gitter</a> and <a href=\"https://webchat.freenode.net/\">#dat on IRC</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues\">Asking and answering questions</a> from other folks on GitHub or StackOverflow;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/substack/jsconfhi2019-offline-p2p-mapping\">Giving a talk</a> and mentioning the project;</li>\n<li>Running <a href=\"http://sfpc.io/\">a conference or hackathon</a> to invite folks to the community;</li>\n<li>Creating a <a href=\"http://npmjs.com/kappa-core\">new open source module</a> that builds upon others' work;</li>\n<li>Opening <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore/pull/195\">a pull request</a> to one of the many (hundreds, if not thousands) of modules that power the core user interfaces (<a href=\"http://github.com/datproject/dat\">commandline</a>, <a href=\"http://github.com/dat-land/dat-desktop\">desktop</a>, <a href=\"http://beakerbrowser.com\">beaker</a>, and <a href=\"http://github.com/datproject/dat-js\">client libraries</a>);</li>\n<li>Fixing <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/docs/commit/12062521498b51353ce111169d56f0272fbd62ab\">typos in documentation</a>;</li>\n<li>Creating and facilitating <a href=\"https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm/\">weekly community-communication (comm-comm) meetings </a>;</li>\n<li>Writing a blog post that <a href=\"https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/dweb-readiness-runet\">mentions the project and suggests new ways forward</a>;</li>\n<li>and the list goes on...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks again for being an amazing developer community.</p>\n",

",
      "content_html": "<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/\">How Dat Works</a></strong></em> is a new guide that explains how computers running Dat communicate with each other to share files. Today is the first release of this documentation and we‚Äôre looking for new readers and feedback!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/\"><img src=\"/content/images/2019/01/how_dat_works_visual_index_v2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of How Dat Works\"></a></p>\n<p><em>How Dat Works</em> is focused on explanation and being accessible to a wide variety of readers, including newcomers who just want to get the gist of what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes of Dat. However, there is also enough detail for implementers to find out exactly what bytes they need to send over the network to make a compatible implementation.</p>\n<p>The most visible aspect of this is the pictures. By area, <em>How Dat Works</em> is three-quarters pictures and one quarter text.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2019/01/how_dat_works_by_area_v2.png\" alt=\"Figure showing a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the guide with pictures and text highlighted in different colors\"></p>\n<p>Where text is used I‚Äôve tried to keep the language as simple as possible. Concepts are introduced throughout the guide as they are needed in order to keep it readable from start to end. Almost every concept is introduced with an example or by showing it in context. Visual aspects such as layout, alignment, whitespace, repetition and color are underused in technical documentation so <em>How Dat Works</em> makes heavy use of these.</p>\n<p>Dat is reaching a point where people are experimenting with posting their writing, art, music and personal websites on it. As more experimentation happens and more people post their work on Dat, it becomes compelling for multiple implementations of the protocol to exist. Dat was originally written in JavaScript and now the community is also working on a Rust implementation.</p>\n<p>I hope that with <em>How Dat Works</em> being available, people considering writing new implementations will have an easier time understanding the steps to make that happen. <em>How Dat Works</em> is programming-language agnostic and currently doesn‚Äôt contain a single line of code, but instead shows the structures and algorithms that are necessary regardless of programming language. Source code can still be useful to get another perspective and dig into details, so the guide also has links to implementations throughout it for readers who are interested.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd like to thank Mozilla for funding this work and the Dat community for supporting it, through the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/organization/tree/master/grants/2018-MOSS\">Mozilla Open Source Support grant</a> to Dat. It‚Äôs not often that open source projects get funding for full-time documentation writers. I‚Äôd also like to thank the Dat Project for being willing to take a risk and try out a radically different style of technical documentation like this. There is still a huge space to explore with respect to documenting computer programs and protocols. It does take time and effort, but I think it‚Äôs worthwhile to make internet infrastructure understandable for people who use it but don‚Äôt happen to be programmers.</p>\n<p>Being the first release of this documentation there will be snagging points and parts that could be explained better. I‚Äôm relying on reader feedback to find out where these are. <a href=\"https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/\">Have a read</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/R22N7C3e0trxNn9h1\">tell me which parts you found confusing</a> so that I can improve them. Thanks and please enjoy!</p>\n<p><em>(Cover art is a derivative of Ben Simonds‚Äô Jungle Temple from <a href=\"https://nostarch.com/blendermasterclass\">Blender Master Class</a>)</em></p>\n",

We are particularly excited about PREreview‚Äôs potential to accelerate the process of scholarly information sharing and to open the profession of research to underrepresented communities. PREreview will join our Sponsored Projects, <a href=\"https://datproject.org/\">Dat Project</a>, <a href=\"https://datproject.org/\">Stencila</a>, and <a href=\"https://datproject.org/\">ScienceFair</a>. Read on for a deeper dive into the issues that PREreview is tackling, where the project is headed and how we‚Äôll partner with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scientific-research-is-slowed-down-by-the-peer-review-process\">Scientific research is slowed down by the peer review process <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#scientific-research-is-slowed-down-by-the-peer-review-process\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What is peer review? Peer review is a process of critical review of a scientific scholarly work. In its most common form, it is conducted immediately prior to publication by a handful of unpaid and anonymous reviewers, often selected by the publisher. They decide the soundness of the science behind closed doors and send feedback to the authors. This process can involve waiting periods of nine months or more.</p>\n<p><strong>That‚Äôs right, research published today could have been in publishing limbo for months or even years.</strong></p>\n<p>Science is already a slow process. Scholars across disciplines have been frustrated by the way peer review is conducted for decades. On top of the slow pace of review, reviewers are selected opaquely by journal editors. This process disadvantages early career scientists not yet known to editors, women, and scientists from underrepresented communities. These groups are neither asked to contribute to peer review, nor is their work evaluated by inclusive and diverse reviewers. Finally, and paradoxically, while peer review is an important component of being a scientist, very few receive any training in it. How can we accelerate science and build a inclusive training community to change the pool of scientific reviewers?</p>\n<h2 id=\"preprints-add-transparency-and-speed-up-the-dissemination-process%2C-but-problems-remain\">Preprints add transparency and speed up the dissemination process, but problems remain <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#preprints-add-transparency-and-speed-up-the-dissemination-process%2C-but-problems-remain\">#</a></h2>\n<p>More than 25 years ago, physicists developed a solution to this problem: preprints. Preprints are manuscripts that are publicly posted online by the authors, becoming immediately available to the community. They are open access, meaning that anyone with an internet connection can read them, they are citable, meaning that other scientists can refer to them in other publications, and they are versioned, meaning that new updated versions can be published with unique digital object identifiers while old ones never disappear.</p>\n<p>Backed by many <a href=\"http://asapbio.org/funder-policies\">funders</a>, <a href=\"http://asapbio.org/journal-policies\">journals</a>, and <a href=\"http://asapbio.org/university-policies\">institutions</a>, preprints are becoming a legitimate part of research dissemination. They accelerate the dissemination of knowledge, thereby increasing the impact and reach of scientific discovery. But we believe that preprints can do more than just accelerate science. Preprints can be leveraged to open the profession of science to underrepresented populations and democratize access to science on a global scale.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prereview%3A-training%2C-inclusive-community-support%2C-and-credit-for-reviews-of-preprints\">PREreview: Training, inclusive community support, and credit for reviews of preprints <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#prereview%3A-training%2C-inclusive-community-support%2C-and-credit-for-reviews-of-preprints\">#</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/10/PREreview_dreamteam_silly.jpg\" alt=\"PREreview_dreamteam_silly\"> <em>Image: The PREreview team, Dr. Samantha Hindle, Dr. Monica Granados, and about to defend, almost-Dr. Daniela Saderi</em></p>\n<p>PREreview was founded by a team of scientists who want to shift scientific culture to that every scientist posts, reads, and engages with preprints as standard practice. PREreview leadership team, Daniela, Monica, and Samantha, believe that scientists and the public will benefit from open sharing of scientific work and open exchange of feedback. Training to support the development of constructive and inclusive critical review skills is needed to facilitate this culture change.</p>\n<p>PREreview today is an online platform for the collaborative writing of reviews to preprints. The PREreview team shares resources to help scientists understand and advocate for the value of preprints. PREreview also provides peer review templates to make it easier for preprint reviewers to give concise and helpful feedback to authors, and even email templates to communicate the review to them.</p>\n<p>Beyond providing a platform for the community to grow and exchange content, the team also recognizes the lack of training in peer review. Early career researchers learn when and if their superiors involve them in the peer review process as trainees. Lack of formal training in this critical scientific skill contributes to the homogeneous demographics of today‚Äôs reviewer pool. It also leads to widely variable approaches to peer review.  To address this gap, PREreview offers students and early career scientists opportunities to build skills in peer review and support to form both on-campus and online PREreview groups. Also, they are currently designing a peer review training program that will allow reviewers to gain skills, be formally recognized for their contributions, and build a diverse pool of reviewers in every scholarly field.</p>\n<p>Their work also involves facilitating communication between scientists, particularly early career, and (open access) journal editors, with the goal of creating a fluent workflow where everyone is welcomed, trained, and valued for their effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-that-prereview-is-officially-joining-cs%26s%E2%80%99-sponsored-projects-program%3F\">What does it mean that PREreview is officially joining CS&amp;S‚Äô Sponsored Projects Program? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what-does-it-mean-that-prereview-is-officially-joining-cs%26s%E2%80%99-sponsored-projects-program%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>CS&amp;S seeks to incubate open source projects in public interest technology.

      "title": "Announcing The Dat Anacapa Container",
      "content_html": "<p>Today we are releasing <a href=\"http://github.com/datproject/anacapa-container\">Anacapa Container</a>, which enables reproducibility of research environment and data across campuses.</p>\n<p>If you've been following our work over the last year you'll be aware of the Dat in the Lab project, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation (read our previous writeups on <a href=\"/uc-merced-1/\">a lab visit</a>, <a href=\"/draft-pipelines-edna-and-more/\">eDNA</a>, and <a href=\"/challenges-of-decentralized-hpc-containerization/\">containerization challenges</a>). As this project comes to a close, we are excited to release this final piece of work. A final project wrap-up will be released later this fall.</p>\n<p>The Anacapa Container project has been a collaboration between the Code for Science &amp; Society team and researchers at five different University of California campuses: UCLA, UC Merced, UC Davis, UC Riverside and UC Santa Cruz. Our goal was to take the <a href=\"https://github.com/limey-bean/Anacapa\">Anacapa pipeline</a> from UCLA and use a combination of Dat plus containerization technologies to replicate the pipeline across the various University of California research cluster environments.</p>\n<p>The Anacapa pipeline itself is a collection of software written in Bash, Python, R and Perl that takes eDNA sequences and performs computationally expensive and complex analysis on the data to do things such as detect which species were in the sample. Anacapa is the core analysis tool for the CALeDNA consortium, and there are a number of collaborating institutions within California that wish to use the pipeline. Additionally, there are now a growing number of research groups world-wide who are interested in re-using the Anacapa pipeline for their own local eDNA research.</p>\n<h4 id=\"problem%3A-complex-software-installation\">Problem: Complex Software Installation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#problem%3A-complex-software-installation\">#</a></h4>\n<p>One of the most challenging parts of using any complex scientific pipeline is installing all of the necessary software dependencies to run it. This may not seem challenging at first, but scientific software is usually poorly documented, and rarely tested on research servers beyond the ones at the originating institution. A growing number of researchers now are using modern software development practices, such as writing user friendly documentation and putting their projects on GitHub, but it can still be weeks or months of effort to replicate the dependencies from the originating institution at a new software environment.</p>\n<p>In our case, the CALeDNA consortium includes members of 6 universities. This means for a researcher at UC Merced that wants to run Anacapa, they would have to request that the UC Merced Research Cluster install a long list of specific versions of the R, Python, Perl and Shell bioinformatics utilities that UCLA's Hoffman cluster provides. The UCLA-based authors of Anacapa may have never had to do this for certain software packages, as many of them may have already been installed via requests from other researchers who also use the Hoffman cluster. UC Merced has a different independently maintained research cluster. This means a completely different set of pre-installed packages, and a different Linux distribution. All of this results in a lot of back and forth between researchers and research cluster administrators at both campuses to try and debug the many differences that pop up when trying to replicate the exact environment that is composed of dozens of independent software packages.</p>\n<p>When we started working on this project, one particular researcher had already spent two months working on getting the necessary packages installed locally, but had not yet finished them all. We realized we needed a way to simplify the installation of the Anacapa environment so that every new research group could avoid months of setup work.</p>\n<h4 id=\"anacapa-container\">Anacapa Container <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#anacapa-container\">#</a></h4>\n<p>We decided to use the <a href=\"http://github.com/singularityware\">Singularity</a> containerization software as the main dependency for Dat Container. Singularity is an open source software container developed by folks from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, learn more <a href=\"https://www.sylabs.io/\">here</a>. It has a security model that works well for university compute cluster users. While looking into the other options, we learned that the approach taken by the popular container software Docker requires sudo access. Unfortunately, most universities are unable to offer Docker containers to researchers as university compute clusters can not offer that to individual users. Singularity, on the other hand, uses a different technique to load the containerized environment without requiring sudo privileges. Docker is much more popular in the general tech industry, but this issue eliminated it as an option for us. Singularity is a young project that is developing quite rapidly and it has worked well for this application.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/anacapa-container\">Anacapa Container</a> itself is a singularity image that we developed to include all of the software dependencies needed to run the Anacapa Toolkit from UCLA. We have a script called a Containerfile that step-by-step installs each software package into a Ubuntu Linux server operating system disk image file. At the end of the process, a single 2GB disk image file can be distributed. Instead of requiring that the numerous dependencies get installed onto new systems, the only dependency is the Singularity runtime. This simplifies the request a researcher has to maketo their system administrator.</p>\n<p>To make it easy for people on other UC campuses to run Anacapa, we have been involved in getting Singularity installed at five UC campuses. Even though Singularity is a relatively straightforward package, we encounted numerous install errors that had to be corrected with tedious back and forth remote technical support with sysadmins. Even with our streamlined approach that only required one new package get installed (singularity), it was still painful at times. This issue is faced by anyone looking to share resources between institutions. We are hoping that we can improve this process for others who wish to share analysis environments. Singularity is now up and running at five UC campuses, and any future projects that use Singularity images as a distribution format will require zero new software package requests, as they already have everything they need.</p>\n<p>Dat sits in the Anacapa software container and is used to replicate the details of the original Anacapa compute environment.This means that the as the container is replicated and reused, folks can use Dat to version and share their new versions of the container environment.</p>\n<p>To work with the Anacapa Container, users only need to download the Anacapa Container file, run a singularity command, and they are in a shell prompt that has all of the Anacapa software pre-installed. Due to the containerization approach that Singularity takes, the heavy compute resources on the host machines are available as native resources in the container, meaning there is no loss in performance (as is the case with virtualization based approaches like VirtualBox).</p>\n<h4 id=\"software-as-data\">Software as data <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#software-as-data\">#</a></h4>\n<p>We often think as data as separate from analysis scripts, software, and compute environments. In reality, these are different types of digital information that can be handled by Dat. By treating the software as data, we can approach preservation, versioning, and sharing differently.  We like the simplicity of the single file disk images that Singularity uses, as it fits well with the Dat ethos of sharing your research as one folder that includes your manuscript, your datasets, your papers website, and now your entire research software environment.</p>\n<p>This another step towards easy software reproducibility. The image ensures all of the exact software versions required are being used at runtime. The traditional problem of a system wide update of a Python package breaking everyones existing scripts that depended on the old version is no longer an issue. Researchers can simply load the environment they want by grabbing a specific Singularity image.</p>\n<p>By representing the software environment as a file that can get archived along with the dataset, we can ensure future researchers can always quickly get up and running in their quest to reproduce or modify the Anacapa pipeline. One of our partners on this project is the California Digital Library, who are a group inside the University of California that (among other things) are developing tools to ensure research datasets can get archived and made accessible forever. The challenge at hand is building a system that can coordinate dataset archiving across the giant distributed system that is the University of California and all of the external research groups that depend on UC data.</p>\n<p>We have made this work <a href=\"https://dash.ucmerced.edu/stash/dataset/doi:10.6071/M31H29\">available through DASH</a>, which is a data repository hosted by California Digital Library. Any UC researcher has access to publish datasets through DASH, and we are hoping Anacapa Container can serve as a model for how to distribute reproducible software as part of the research dataset.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dat-and-singularity\">Dat and Singularity <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-and-singularity\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Distributing the research container as a single file means that it can be used in conjunction with Dat as the distribution tool. We have only scratched the surface of the possibilities here, but we are looking forward to more partnerships with data repository providers like California Digital Library and the Internet Archive to build a distributed data archive that includes executable software containers. This would ensure data does not simply go to a data repository never to get used again, as the container would allow for the dataset to become interactive and available instantly.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>We are excited to announce that Dat Project received a $34,000 grant to support Community Building, Protocol Documentation, and Tooling through the <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/\">Mozilla Open Source Support</a> (MOSS) program.</p>\n<p>Alongside our Mozilla Open Web Fellow, we hope this grant helps us showcase the existing community and introduce other communities to Dat. This grant is particularly noteworthy because it is the first grant Dat has received for ongoing maintenance of Dat (not driven by new features or related projects). This is an area of critical funding for open source as highlighted Nadia Eghbal's <a href=\"https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/\">report on Open Source Infrastructure</a>.</p>\n<p>To receive this grant, we needed a Mozilla Champion. We are happy to have the Mozilla <a href=\"https://voice.mozilla.org/en\">Common Voice</a> project interested in using Dat to distribute data. This grant is a first step to support their needs for data publishing and distribution. We are excited to collaborate with Mozilla to make the Dat community more accessible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"milestones\">Milestones <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#milestones\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We are working towards three milestones for this grant:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Community Experience Research</li>\n<li>Dat.Land Community Prototype</li>\n<li>Dat Documentation &amp; Implementation Guide</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community Experience Research</strong> Before jumping into documentation we want to identify what our needs are and how other communities have successfully addressed those needs.</li>\n<li><strong>dat.land Community Prototype</strong> With the Dat community, we have an amazing number of interesting projects, demos, or other bits that we'd like to find a place to share -- we hope <code>dat.land</code> can be that place.</li>\n<li><strong>Dat Documentation &amp; Implementation Guide</strong> Finally, we recognize the need to generally improve documentation and details around protocol implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"get-in-touch\">Get In Touch <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#get-in-touch\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Do you have experience in user research and documentation, especially in open source communities?

This is the next big step for the Dat protocol. Hyperdb sets the stage for enabling multiwriter databases. In other words, allowing multiple people to write to a Dat. This is the culmination of many years of work and will enable all kinds of new use cases, including <a href=\"https://github.com/jimpick\">Jim Pick's</a> <a href=\"/dat-shopping-list/\">collaborative shopping list</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mmoma.ru/exhibitions/gogolevsky10-2/vedutsya_revolyucionnye_raboty/\">art</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cabal-club/cabal-desktop\">chat</a>, and more!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yoshuawuyts.com/\">Yoshua Wuyts</a> talked about working on a Rust implementation of Dat, funded by the German <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prototypefund/\">Prototype Fund</a>. The issue he is addressing is that Dat is written in javascript - so it doesn't run everywhere. Yosh's approach is to port bits and pieces to low-level language. He's 3/4 done implementing hypercore and hasn't hit roadblock - so the experiment is going quite well! The goal is to build a mobile-friendly Dat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://lucid00.com/\">Hugh Isaacs II</a> joined us from New York. He's made a <a href=\"https://github.com/HughIsaacs2/DatPart\">Dat Chrome extension</a> and he spoke at the last <a href=\"https://peer-to-peer-web.com/nyc\">p2p web event in NYC</a> (we'll post the link to his talk when it's available). Hugh is interested in offline friendly tech. Zombie apocalypse example - limited power, limited networking -  how do we connect in those types of situations? Even in NYC, disasters like Hurricane Sandy show the importance of being ready with offline friendly tools. Hugh is focused on trying to get the word out there and highlight the ability for protocols like Dat to work offline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/npscience\">Naomi Penfold, PhD</a> just ran a productive and inclusive hackathon - <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b4ed92e1/innovation-collaboration-and-creativity-at-the-heart-of-the-elife-innovation-sprint-2018?utm_source=CSS&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sprint-IE\">The eLife Innovation Sprint</a> - in Cambridge, UK.

Measurement Lab's mission is to measure the internet, save data, make it easy for people understand. To do this, they partner with Open Tech Institute, Planet Lab (Princeton), and Google. Since 2009, they've been working to provide OS platform to host measurement tests. This means you can ask &quot;how fast is my connection?&quot; and get a real answer for your actual house. They collect data from millions and millions of measurements per day. Right now they're working on a project to with colleagues at Simmons College &amp; Internet2 to make better system for libraries - learn more at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xuJhB5rnVLTRXE2xP4vX2vRqOUd3y3_PzPaD2tcwhTM/edit#slide=id.g37eeb48ad2_0_97\">Chris' slide deck</a>.

",
      "content_html": "<p>Research and cultural heritage institutions are facing increasing costs to preserve digital objects like scientific data, digital art, and other artifacts. As many institutions move data to cloud services, preservation costs and complexity are quickly becoming concerns. We are announcing a project to prototype shared infrastructure for digital preservation: Cooperative Preservation Network.</p>\n<p>Together with other leading institutions in decentralization and digital preservation, Code for Science &amp; Society, the Internet Archive, and California Digital Library, we aim to demonstrate how decentralized technology can bolster existing institutional infrastructure. Built on a decentralized network using the Dat Protocol, this project aims to enable public organizations who preserve digital cultural heritage to backup and monitor digital assets.</p>\n<p>Dat is already being used by researchers, developers, and artists. This project aims to identify institutional limitations to using decentralized technology, whether technical and social. To test our assumptions, we will prototype a network allowing each participating entity to view and download the collections of other participants. If successful, this project will demonstrate how to reduce preservation costs while increasing preservation assurance, as members of a cooperative, decentralized network mutually support each other to ensure adequate copies of data are maintained.</p>\n<p>Open infrastructure allows institutions to use digital preservation tooling without locking them into specific paid services or locking data into a patchwork of data silos. By working with the Dat Protocol, we will build this project to maximize flexibility and interoperability. Our goal is not to replace existing institutional infrastructure but to make it more capable by linking institutions at a foundational level. Building on value-driven open infrastructure, this project aims to identify new opportunities for collaboration between institutions and community engagement in data preservation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-forward\">Moving Forward <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#moving-forward\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Despite improvements in data preservation and access, today‚Äôs digital preservation solutions rely on storage of objects in centralized servers. This model is built on traditional web infrastructure, which was designed with the values of commercial organizations. It‚Äôs time for scholars to ask whether today‚Äôs data preservation technologies align with open scholarship‚Äôs values of access, preservation, privacy, and transparency.</p>\n<p>This project will be a community-driven infrastructure that values openness and bakes access into the code.

      "title": "Collaborative Communities at CZI Human Cell Atlas Meeting",
      "content_html": "<p>At the end of April we joined scientists working on <a href=\"https://www.chanzuckerberg.com/science\">Chan Zuckerberg Science's</a> (CZI) <a href=\"https://www.humancellatlas.org/\">Human Cell Atlas</a> (HCA) project to facilitate a session on collaboration for scientists. Improving communities ability to collaborate is a core focus of the <a href=\"https://codeforscience.org/\">Code for Science &amp; Society</a> mission. We facilitate in-person events, share our processes openly, and join community groups like the <a href=\"https://osaos.org/\">Open Source Alliance for Open Scholarship</a> and <a href=\"http://jrost.org/\">Joint Roadmap for Open Source Tools</a> to advance this mission. Our unique perspective on collaboration and open source comes from work with projects and people across domains from science to the arts. What does this facilitation process look like? Read on to find out!</p>\n<p>A successful collaboration depends on people and communication. Learning how to leverage tools like Git is part of the process. To develop a sustainable collaborative process, we work through a blockers and concerns to create a project-specific method for collaboration. Our process looks a little different each time and is shaped by the needs of the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"facilitating-collaboration-with-git-for-computational-biology\">Facilitating Collaboration with Git for Computational Biology <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#facilitating-collaboration-with-git-for-computational-biology\">#</a></h2>\n<p>At the CZI HCA event, we worked with research scientists for two hours with the goal of improving their collaborative processes. The participants represented a mix of computational biologists, bench biologists, students, postdocs, and faculty. Most of the people at the session were familiar with Git but not regularly using it for collaboration. It's often easier to learn Git than it is to develop a Git-based workflow for a group. The basics of Git can be covered in a day. Developing a lab workflow that is sustainable takes communication, iteration, and commitment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"starting-with-terms-and-concepts\">Starting with terms and concepts <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#starting-with-terms-and-concepts\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To ensure a successful session, we make sure everyone is comfortable with the terms and on the same page. We began with a terminology review of Git. This helps to raise a questions (e.g. when to make a branch vs when to fork) that we return to later. We also reviewed the role of common files, such as a README, that help set a project's norms and expectations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"motivations-and-blockers\">Motivations and blockers <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#motivations-and-blockers\">#</a></h3>\n<p>After discussing terminology, we to motivations and blockers. We wanted to surface attendee motivations and blockers in team collaboration. To get at this information, we asked attendees to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What's the easiest part of your daily collaborations?</li>\n<li>What do you want to improve?</li>\n<li>What is keeping your team from using a Git-based workflow?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"what's-easy%3F\">What's easy? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what's-easy%3F\">#</a></h4>\n<p>To identify and create standardized communication and software development practices for their labs, we started with what's working. We ask the question &quot;What's the easiest part of your daily collaborations?&quot; to start participants off thinking about what works for them now. Later, when we discuss blockers, we can return to &quot;what's easy&quot; and re-frame the blocker in terms of what the participants have identified as easy for them. We saw answers such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in-person conversations</li>\n<li>regular communications they have with their lab</li>\n<li>when I know who is responsible for what</li>\n<li>we know who needs to make decisions</li>\n<li>communication is clear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two categories of answers came up. Conversations with people and situations where expectations are clear are the core of well-done group collaboration.<br>\n<em>(One participant who runs a research group brought up SCRUM, see <a href=\"https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/10743\">Adapting Scrum to Managing a Research Group</a> for more.)</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"what-needs-work%3F\">What needs work? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what-needs-work%3F\">#</a></h4>\n<p>By asking &quot;What do you want to improve?&quot; we looked for common themes motivating participants to attend the session. Most of the participants already knew how to use Git. However, a knowledge of Git does not guarantee a smooth collaboration and a successful project.</p>\n<p>There were two categories of responses: technical skills and project management. Some participants wanted to improve their working knowledge of Git, for example a person who understands branches but is not sure that they're doing <em>right</em> and is looking for best practices. Other participants wanted to improve their team's approach to project management and were interested in implementing code review, standups, and other processes to keep the team working together efficiently. Some of the answers were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get a handle on branches, forks, merges</li>\n<li>get everyone on team aligned doing things the same way</li>\n<li>getting feedback regularly</li>\n<li>code review</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Code for Science and Society has put a lot of effort into understanding and developing systems for diverse teams. We've seen that the best process tends to be the one that can be adopted and sustained. In our discussions of best practices, we surfaced some key points, reviewed open source best practices, shared community resources like <a href=\"http://openopensource.org/\">openopensource.org</a>, and discussed how to use issue templates.</p>\n<h4 id=\"blockers\">Blockers <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#blockers\">#</a></h4>\n<p>With a view of what was easy for participants and what they wanted to improve, we then moved on to discuss the specific blockers. We did this by asking, &quot;What is keeping your team from a Git-based workflow?&quot; Interestingly, the main blockers were things we classify as <em>people problems</em> rather than technical problems. Examples included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>people in my lab have different levels of understanding of Git</li>\n<li>communication ‚Äî lack of common language, lack of Git familiarity</li>\n<li>some people don't like change</li>\n<li>students have projects of their own and don't have collaboration needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While most of our participants had a good understanding of Git, not everyone in their work groups are at the same level. This creates situations where there is no common process or understanding. Fortunately, team members don't need a deep understanding of Git to collaborate. People who are not familiar with Git can use the GitHub web interface to submit issues and comments, contribute to project management with GitHub Projects, and write documentation and user guides. This is critical to helping those people develop comfort with GitHub and incorporating them into a Git-based workflow, even if they won't be making commits for a while.</p>\n<p>The last two points raised by participants fall into the &quot;we don't need to bother with this&quot; category. Some people don't like change. However, we have seen people who are resistant to change get on board quickly once they see a project progressing. An open source style workflow allows anyone in the group to see project progress, and this tends to have a motivating effect on supervisors and others.</p>\n<p>The flip side of &quot;we don't need to bother with this&quot; is a scientist who is used to working independently. In most groups there is an expectation that their code and methods will be reused by future lab members. Even an independent project can benefit from code review. We encourage people to onboard independent workers with a code review process that formalizes and documents the comments that are already happening in the lab. <em>(See <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vievehal/c3fa3ff081afb2d7f0d0bf8a024468ab\">this Gist</a> on code review and scientific review in labs.

There's no magic recipe for a good collaboration. Attendees were able to connect with other groups who collaborate with Git. At an event like the CZI HCA meeting, the opportunity to make connections with other groups working towards better project management on similar projects is valuable. Finally, by creating a space for honest discussion, we set up groups to evaluate their existing project management workflows, surface and discuss blockers to best practices with their labs, and push for improvements.</p>\n<p>We're always interested in working with groups to bring the best of open source workflows to projects in new domains.

(Credit: @mafintosh)</small></p>\n<p>Dat is a purpose-built tool to allow sharing of research data in a way that enables effective collaboration and reproducibility. Out-of-the-box, it gives you a distributed network, data history, and security. With the development of HyperDB, we are excited to see Dat growing to the foundation for other community collaboration tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-is-growing-and-evolving\">Dat is growing and evolving <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-is-growing-and-evolving\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Since its initial release, Dat has attracted an enthusiastic developer community with ideas and use cases that extend beyond its original mission. Dat has evolved into a whole ecosystem of related open source tools, libraries, and services. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <code>dat</code> <a href=\"https://docs.datproject.org/install#in-the-terminal\">command line tool</a> for sharing data (<a href=\"https://try-dat.com/\">online tutorial</a>)</li>\n<li>the <a href=\"https://github.com/dat-land/dat-desktop\">Dat Desktop</a> app for sharing files over the internet</li>\n<li>a full ecosystem of open source libraries in <a href=\"https://docs.datproject.org/ecosystem\">JavaScript</a> (plus a new <a href=\"https://datrs.yoshuawuyts.com/\">Rust</a> project is growing fast)</li>\n<li>commercial services such as <a href=\"https://hashbase.io/\">Hashbase</a> are providing hosted solutions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com/\">Beaker Browser</a> is a powerful vision of a web browser that gives all people the power to publish their work to the web without servers</li>\n<li>the community has even organized grassroots <a href=\"https://peer-to-peer-web.com/\">Peer-to-Peer Web</a> conferences in Los Angeles and Berlin, and soon New York</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/peer-to-peer-web-la-tara.jpg\" alt=\"peer-to-peer-web-la-tara\"><br>\n<small>Tara Vancil giving a talk at Peer-to-Peer Web L.A. (Credit: @jimpick)</small></p>\n<p>Dat is designed to evolve. The initial version of Dat was designed to allow a single researcher to publish a set of files to the world, and to be able to update the files over time ... all while preserving history for reproducibility. But quickly, Dat caught on with other use in a variety of communities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hyperdb%3A-dat-multiwriter\">HyperDB: Dat Multiwriter <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#hyperdb%3A-dat-multiwriter\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One of the most desired features for Dat is collaboration between multiple users, known as <em>multiwriter</em> (as opposed to <em>singlewriter</em>, which Dat is currently). We especially heard this need in the <a href=\"/dat-in-the-lab-ucdavis-1/\">feedback from the research community</a>. Led by Mathias Buus (<a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh\">@mafintosh</a>), we have spent more than a year developing HyperDB, a distributed key-value database. Alongside this, we are upgrading the core internal libraries of Dat to use HyperDB and support improved collaboration. HyperDB is working today, but we are continuing to test and integrate into hyperdrive and other Dat tools.</p>\n<p>Multiwriter support is a major change. To ensure a smooth roll out, we are working with the <a href=\"http://github.com/datprotocol/\">Dat Protocol Working Group</a> to define backwards compatibility requirements. This process, and work on integration will be a priority in the coming months.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-shopping-list-demo\"><em>Dat Shopping List</em> Demo <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-shopping-list-demo\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The <em>Dat Shopping List</em> application demonstrates how to use HyperDB to collaborate with other users on a single database. We built this to showcase multiwriter support and guide others on its use. <a href=\"https://codeforscience.org/\">Code for Science &amp; Society</a>, the non-profit organization sponsoring Dat, contracted me (<a href=\"https://jimpick.com/\">Jim Pick</a>) to demonstrate how HyperDB works, improve any API peculiarities, and surface any remaining bugs.</p>\n<p>You can launch the demo in any web browser:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dat-shopping-list.glitch.me/\">https://dat-shopping-list.glitch.me/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/dat-shopping-list-basic.gif\" alt=\"dat-shopping-list-basic\"><br>\n<small>A quick preview of what you can do with the app</small></p>\n<p>The demo is a simple to do list app, in the spirit of the <a href=\"http://todomvc.com/\">TodoMVC</a> project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"video-walkthrough\">Video Walkthrough <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#video-walkthrough\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Here is a short (2.5 minute) walkthrough of the demo.</p>\n<p><video src=\"https://dat-shopping-list-video-jimpick.hashbase.io/dat-shopping-list-1.mp4\" controls></video></p>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phone-support\">Mobile phone support <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#mobile-phone-support\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Where the demo really shines is on your mobile phone. The demo is built using some <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/\">cutting-edge</a> web browser features, so you can use <em>Add to Home Screen</em> on your phone, and you can use it just like you would use any other app.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/dat-shopping-list-pwa.jpg\" alt=\"dat-shopping-list-pwa\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"offline-support\">Offline support <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#offline-support\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When you create a shopping list, under the covers, you are actually creating a multiwriter Dat archive. Each shopping list is a separate Dat archive, and each shopping list item is just a tiny little file inside a directory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/dat-next-under-the-covers.png\" alt=\"dat-next-under-the-covers\"></p>\n<p>The master copy is stored in the storage of your web browser, along with the secret key which ensures that you are the only one that can modify it.</p>\n<p>Having the master copy inside your web browser is great, because that lets you make changes to the document, even when you aren't connected to the internet. So you can put your phone in airplane mode, and still use the app.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/online-offline.gif\" alt=\"online-offline\"><br>\n<small>Making changes anytime is okay, even when offline. Changes sync when going back online.</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"synchronizing-and-keys\">Synchronizing and Keys <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#synchronizing-and-keys\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Of course, a multiwriter demo would be boring if it only ran on one device. Dat has always had great support for replicating data across the internet.</p>\n<p>Dat has been single writer up until now, and it's identity model was essentially a single <em>key pair</em>, a set of keys ‚Äî one public key and one private key. With the new support for multiple writers, each writer will have its own key pair, and users exchange keys to grant access to new writers.</p>\n<p>In this demo, the user shares their keys to the shopping list owners to get authorized.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/authorization-1.png\" alt=\"authorization-1\"><br>\n<small>We authorize new writers by copying and pasting their keys into the owners shopping list.</small></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/05/authorization-2.png\" alt=\"authorization-2\"><br>\n<small>Once authorized, other users can update the shopping list.</small></p>\n<p>A truly user-friendly application might hide the keys and key exchange details from the end users by incorporating some sort of identity-based account and login system. But, for this demo, we wanted to illustrate the core authorization mechanism that multiwriter Dat uses. Asking people to understand and do the key exchange manually is not very friendly, but it is flexible and powerful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node.js-gateway\">Node.js Gateway <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#node.js-gateway\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This demo works in any modern browser. It has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge, as well as Mobile Safari and Chrome on Android.</p>\n<p>If the demo had been written for <a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com/\">Beaker Browser</a>, which speaks the Dat protocol natively to the internet, there would be no need for a gateway. But in order to allow the demo to work across many browsers, the app replicates the shopping list data across a websocket connection to the server from which it was loaded. The Node.js server will then talk to the rest of the peer-to-peer swarm on behalf of the client.</p>\n<p>By necessity, the data is shared with the gateway, so if you want to share data privately, you will need to run your own private gateway. It is not as scary as it sounds though... all the code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/jimpick/dat-shopping-list\">GitHub</a>, and you can <a href=\"https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/dat-shopping-list\">remix</a> the demo on Glitch with a single click.</p>\n<h3 id=\"podcast-interview-with-mathias-buus\">Podcast Interview with Mathias Buus <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#podcast-interview-with-mathias-buus\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If you would like to learn a bit more, Mathias was a recent guest on the <a href=\"https://dat-cast.hashbase.io/\">DatCast podcast</a> and talked a bit about the origins of the Dat project and how multiwriter and hyperdb came to be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-the-dat-project!!!\">Support the Dat Project!!! <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#support-the-dat-project!!!\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://codeforscience.org/\">Code for Science &amp; Society</a> for hiring me to build the demo.

      "content_html": "<p>Data intensive research depends increasingly on the sharing and reuse of datasets. Unfortunately, collaboration can be stalled by technical roadblocks around sharing large datasets between institutions. Today, sharing files between institutions remains challenging without extensive technical infrastructure or external services.</p>\n<p>As a part of the <a href=\"/tags/science/\">Dat in the Lab</a> project ‚Äî a project done in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.cdlib.org/\">California Digital Library</a> and funded by the <a href=\"https://www.moore.org/\">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a>  ‚Äî we have worked with University of California researchers to better understand barriers in their work. This is part of our participant-driven design process and our goal is to identify where we can remove blockers for people in data intensive fields with Dat-based workflows. What have we learned? Read on!</p>\n<p>At the start of the project, one issue came up immediately ‚Äî researchers still struggle to share large datasets between institutions. Why is this? Many commercial or open platforms exist for transferring files. But many of these tools require file transfer through a centralized server. By adding a third party, the act of transferring a file becomes more complex, more expensive, and reduces security. Dat works by linking the two people directly, without needing a third-party server. However, as anyone who's worked in institutional computing knows, connecting two institutional networks is not always straightforward. As we learned, institutional network security does not always mix well with peer-to-peer protocols.</p>\n<p>We want make Dat great for researchers, but many researchers lack access to install software globally on their systems. With that in mind, we also created a new simplified install process and improved the feedback in the Dat command line tool to make it more intuitive. Our new installation method makes it easy to install Dat without <code>sudo</code> or <code>npm</code>, in just one step!</p>\n<p>We've always aimed to make Dat great at data transfer. But sitting down with researchers and walking through each step showed us where we needed to improve. Dat in the Lab has provided new chances to try Dat out in new contexts, with folks at various levels of experience. From these experiences, we have made improvement that will make Dat easier for everyone to use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"case-study%3A-uc-davis-to-washington-state-university-data-transfer\">Case Study: UC Davis to Washington State University Data Transfer <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#case-study%3A-uc-davis-to-washington-state-university-data-transfer\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a short summary of a recent data sharing use case we facilitated. We've designed a workflow to enable researchers to share data across institutions, from easy installation to direct data transfer.</p>\n<p>For Dat in the Lab, we helped a researcher from UC Davis securely share pre-publication genomic data with an external collaborator based in Washington State. At UC Davis, PhD student Ryan Peek is sequencing Sierra yellow-legged frogs (endangered species, Rana Sierrae) and Meghan Parsley, a PhD student at Washington State University (WSU) wants to collaborate on Ryan‚Äôs data.</p>\n<p>In the end, we successfully helped Ryan and Meghan to send the data from Ryan‚Äôs server at Davis to Meghan's laptop at WSU. Ryan‚Äôs genomics group at Davis had a server that we installed Dat onto using the new standalone installer method. Ryan used the <code>dat share</code> command (in the folder where his data was located) to start sharing his research data and sent the Dat link to Meghan.</p>\n<p>Initially, we tried to transfer the data onto a server on the internal network at WSU. We immediately ran into connection problems, where Dat was unable to connect to external networks. To troubleshoot this, we ran <code>dat doctor</code> on both ends. Dat doctor tests general connectivity and provides a command to test peer-to-peer connectivity. The Dat doctor determined that the server at WSU was not able to connect directly to Davis, most likely due to institutional firewall settings. We are always try to make the doctor better at spotting networking issues that may prevent Dat from working!</p>\n<p>To get away from the institutional firewall, we instead transfered the data to a researcher's laptop. It worked! Ryan and Meghan were able to exchange data directly between their computers. This transfer did not require any external infrastructure or costly platforms. Additionally, Meghan was able to close her laptop and have the data transfer automatically resume when she was back online. Dat provides researchers with flexibility for quick file transfers with powerful features underneath for users that need more advanced features.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work-flow-%E2%80%94-dat-for-data-transfer\">Work Flow ‚Äî Dat For Data Transfer <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#work-flow-%E2%80%94-dat-for-data-transfer\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Interested in beta testing Dat for secure data sharing?

I'll update with the link to the recording when it's available.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Technology is imbued with the values and biases of its creators (see the work of <a href=\"https://safiyaunoble.com/\">Safiya Noble</a> for more). Today‚Äôs online data storage and preservation systems are no exception. They are built on traditional web infrastructure, which was designed with the values of hierarchical and commercial organizations. It‚Äôs time for scholars to ask whether today‚Äôs data preservation technologies align with open scholarship‚Äôs values of access, preservation, privacy, and transparency. Alternative communication tools, such as email and RSS, were built for interoperability and portability but are now largely relegated to (small) uses. Similar approaches built with decentralized technology have recently reached a new level of maturity and publicity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It‚Äôs time for scholars to ask whether today‚Äôs data preservation technologies align with open scholarship‚Äôs values of access, preservation, privacy, and transparency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Decentralized tools offer a more robust, open alternative for data management. At a fundamental level, decentralized systems distribute data across a network of linked participants. Beyond scholarly use cases, decentralized models are also changing the way the web is built as artists, activists, and technologists use them to rethink the web. This technology offers new models for community managed information sharing on the web. As decentralization remakes the legacy web, it presents scholarship with an opportunity to rethink who owns scholarly data and the pathways to access that information.</p>\n<p>Today, decentralized approaches like the Dat Project offer foundational tools for integrating isolated data silos, operating at a lower level of web infrastructure to link information in existing systems. (At the end of this post is a plain language <a href=\"https://datproject.org/\">Dat Project</a> explainer.) These modern tools present opportunities for scholars, librarians, and technologists to redesign long-term data preservation in a way that formalizes the shared values of the community within the technology itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-internet-is-broken-and-we-are-using-it-to-access-and-distribute-all-of-human-knowledge.\">The Internet is broken and we are using it to access and distribute all of human knowledge. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-internet-is-broken-and-we-are-using-it-to-access-and-distribute-all-of-human-knowledge.\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Today‚Äôs web is dominated by centralized, non-interoperable entities that sustain their businesses by enclosing and selling data we provide to them. The model of controlling content via an online platform has been implemented in every industry, from social media to scholarly publishing. We live in an age where data are increasingly collected, analyzed, and repackaged for sale. Across domains, data live online (I mean data in the most inclusive terms): the work of a writer, government data, newspaper archives, your family photos, scientific data, film archives, artist‚Äôs creations. These data live on the web with varying degrees of strategy, management, and plans for long-term upkeep.</p>\n<p>The lines drawn around which data have political value, research value, or business value constantly shift. Scholarly data - the majority of which are presented, accessed, and stored online - are not an exception, and can move quickly from niche to politically charged (see <a href=\"http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge/\">DataRescue</a>). Although data are valuable, data management and stewardship practices are extremely inconsistent and financially burdensome. Link rot (when links break) and content drift (when the information at a link changes) plague fields from <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/legal-information-management/article/perma-scoping-and-addressing-the-problem-of-link-and-reference-rot-in-legal-citations/15A59548BF9882B06D3064DA7E290859\">legal judgements and scholarship</a> to <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115253\">biomedical research</a>. Together link rot and content drift create ‚Äúreference rot‚Äù ‚Äî you can read more about the impact of reference rot on scholarship across scholarly disciplines <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/the-trouble-with-reference-rot-1.17465\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ital/article/view/9598\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/02/05/reference-rot-in-web-based-scholarly-communication/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In this landscape, librarians, technologists, and scholars are trying to manage systems that will sustain the preservation of humanity‚Äôs growing knowledge base forever.  The web is not designed for long term preservation of information. As <a href=\"https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2017/01/19/researchers-rush-to-preserve-environmental-data-they-believe-to-be-threatened-by-trump/\">Laurie Allen said in 2017</a>: ‚Äúthe internet is a terribly unstable way to keep information available.‚Äù As decentralized models to connect people to information are developed, these models present a unique opportunity to rethink how scholarly data are stored and accessed online.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-network-approach\">A network approach <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a-network-approach\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Centralized data storage systems can only preserve what they hold in their servers. These models require custody to provide access. Data custody becomes increasingly expensive and difficult to manage as data volumes increase. Stephen Abrams asks the question, <a href=\"https://figshare.com/articles/_/5844369\">‚Äúcan we replace custody with easy access?</a>‚Äù In other words, is knowing where data are, and trusting the preservation standards of that location, equivalent to (or better than) custody? Can we reduce the burden on institutions to own everything with a mandate to know where data are and how many verified copies exist?</p>\n<p>The idea of ‚Äúpreservation in place‚Äù where libraries bring ‚Äúpreservation services to the content‚Äù is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/docs/Abrams-Cruse-Kunze-Preservation-is-not-a-place-final.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1524179362754000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQgSxzZZfwkxpKrNgzvpEl2Kc7eQ\">not new</a>. In a decentralized model, custody is not required for access. By bringing preservation services to content, we replace custody with access and preservation. Data then live in a network of linked institutions that model a commons of trust.</p>\n<p>To create a functional system wherein information is shared across silos between trusted institutions is a utopian idea. What would such a network require beyond technology? The most critical factor is trust. Trust in each participating entity‚Äôs standards and processes. Trust between institutions. Trust from the community that a commons can be sustained without tragedy. Today's decentralized models make preservation in place technically feasible, and interoperable with existing data preservation silos. But perhaps the cultural part of modeling a new system will be more challenging than writing the software? ;)</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-us\">Join us <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#join-us\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Scholarship today is another form of online content creation. I resisted the idea for years. But the parallels are clear. Scholarly work is used by for-profit entities to drive clicks, bring advertisers and subscribers, and sustain their businesses. We give up custody of ‚Äî and sometimes rights to ‚Äî our work. We then must pay for access to our own data and publications, or lose access to those resources. I believe this system is unsustainable because it is not based on the community‚Äôs values. Reducing reliance on centralized systems will help to return the control of scholarly assets to the creators and trusted institutions that value access and scholarship. Data preservation and access are fundamentally about trust. Who do you trust to steward human knowledge? I trust libraries, scholars, and public interest technologists over entities with clear business interests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What‚Äôs important to the scholarly community? Are those values are reflected in our technology?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today‚Äôs online scholarly infrastructure values systems of centralized control, people with reliable internet connections, people/institutions with money to pay for access (when there‚Äôs no money ‚Äî it values people/institutions with the technical capacity and time to do the work themselves).  The web is being reimagined today as a network wherein data are freely shared between linked users. For scholars and librarians, it‚Äôs a chance to step back and assess what assumptions and values are baked in to today‚Äôs open scholarly infrastructure. What‚Äôs important to the scholarly community? Are those values are reflected in our technology? Let‚Äôs reexamine how scholarship and data live on the web and move into a future where our values are reflected in our technology choices.</p>\n<p>Save the date for our next community call May 31st 11am PST.

It‚Äôs not blockchain based, and instead uses an append only log to track changes and a private key to allow an author to make changes.</p>\n<p>When a folder is tracked with Dat, it creates a unique persistent identifier for that package of data (whatever is in the folder). This unique identifier is not based on location or the folder‚Äôs content. In this system, a folder of data can change location or contain dynamic content while keeping the same identifier. Dat then tracks changes to the contents of the folder with a transparent change log. Any reader can view the change log, early versions of the dataset, or keep the folder synced to always have the latest version.</p>\n<p>The Dat identifier can be used to track that package of data across a network. Using the identifier, anyone can see how many verified copies exist, download copies, and re-share it from another computer. A Dat package can contain any file type and tracking with Dat does not change the contents of the package. It‚Äôs a lightweight and flexible system that prioritizes user control of data sharing across a decentralized network.

",
      "content_html": "<p>Over the last few years, Dat Project has grown from a tool for data transfer to a wider community building peer-to-peer applications. We are continually impressed and excited about the work being done in our community. As the community has grown its needs have changed; to better support and sustain the Dat community, we'll shift our governance and priorities in these areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code for Science &amp; Society (CSS), a nonprofit, and Dat Project, an open source project, will have separate governance structures and leadership.</li>\n<li>Dat will be led and governed with an open source structure through community working groups.</li>\n<li>The Dat Project will focus on building and maintaining a small core of software that:\n<ul>\n<li>Effortlessly synchronizes data between many computers.</li>\n<li>Makes it really easy to build decentralized applications.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes are motivated by seeing what has been working in the Dat community and being open to what needs to be improved for the health of the project. We really like people experimenting with different ways to use Dat and the commitment to creating value-driven decentralized software. We do not like how confusing it can be to get into the Dat ecosystem and the ambiguity over what is supported. We hope these changes improve these hurdles and continue to foster a growing Dat community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"css-%26-dat-project-organizational-structure\">CSS &amp; Dat Project Organizational Structure <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#css-%26-dat-project-organizational-structure\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The biggest structural change is that Dat and Code for Science &amp; Society (the nonprofit that supports Dat) will have separate governance frameworks. The needs, mission, and responsibilities of the nonprofit are different from those of Dat. Dat is an open source project, that needs to sustain a community and provide leadership paths to outside contributors. Our structure has served us so far, but to maintain transparency and focus for both organizations we see the value in separating the governance and leadership.</p>\n<h4 id=\"css-involvement-in-dat%3A\">CSS Involvement in Dat: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#css-involvement-in-dat%3A\">#</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code for Science &amp; Society will continue to fiscally sponsor Dat Project.</li>\n<li>CSS will also sponsor related projects that use Dat, such as <a href=\"http://sciencefair-app.com/\">ScienceFair</a>.</li>\n<li>CSS will continue to build tools with Dat, such as <a href=\"https://datbase.org\">DatBase</a> and software for <a href=\"/tags/science/\">Dat in the Lab</a>, focused on advancing the CSS mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dat-open-source-governance\">Dat Open Source Governance <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-open-source-governance\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We are prioritizing leadership and governance structures around the Dat Project, community governance, and underlying protocol specification in the coming months.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To support the strategy and vision for Dat Project, we will create an open source governance team, led by core Dat Project members and long-time outside contributors. This group will also be involved in financial and legal decisions regarding the Dat Project.</li>\n<li>To advance the protocol development and third-party implementations, we have convened a <a href=\"http://github.com/datprotocol/working-group\">Dat Protocol Working Group</a>. This group will document all aspects of the <a href=\"https://www.datprotocol.com\">Dat specification</a> and make <a href=\"https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs\">protocol decisions</a> moving forward.</li>\n<li>To uphold community values and foster a welcoming community, we will create a working group of community members to uphold the Code of Conduct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In creating these leadership teams and working groups, we aim to ensure a wide variety of stakeholders are involved in strategic and technical decisions. Additionally, we want to provide a pathway to leadership for people from a variety of organizations and with various backgrounds and types of professional expertise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-project-core-focus\">Dat Project Core Focus <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-project-core-focus\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We set out to improve access to public data and created a new protocol along the way. In our work on developing Dat, we found a under-served need. Decentralized software has potential to return control of digital information to the people. Today, building peer-to-peer applications presents both technical and ethical challenges but Dat is slowly changing that. Through projects such as <a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com\">Beaker Browser</a> and Dat-based collaborative tools (e.g. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pvh/pixelpusher-real-time-peer-to-peer-collaboration-with-react-7c7bc8ecbf74\">Pixel Pusher</a>), our community has demonstrated the promise of a new model for digital tools.</p>\n<p>To encourage people to experiment and innovate with decentralized technology, we aim to make Dat foundational software for peer-to-peer applications ‚Äì one that is backed by a mission-driven nonprofit. To realize this future, we want to make sure Dat is really good at the core underlying needs of peer-to-peer applications. We hope that with our small but critical focus, we can create a strong building block for the Dat ecosystem.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"as-always%2C-feedback-welcome!\">As always, feedback welcome! <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#as-always%2C-feedback-welcome!\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There has been great discussion and feedback from our community around these issues, and we want to thank everyone!

We will be hosting these calls every quarter to spread ideas, make connections, and learn about each others projects. As a nonprofit, we work to improve access to knowledge across several domains and this call is a perfect venue for facilitating that.</p>\n<p>Did you miss it? You can watch the <a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/code-for-science-society-community-call/\">the recording</a> and view <a href=\"https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/CodeforScienceandSociety-Community-Call-2018-03-01\">the notes</a>!

We have a unique community! We can pull speakers from friendly and interesting projects across multiple domains who may not cross paths but face similar challenges. It's a chance to bring the global community together to interact between conferences and meetups.</p>\n<p>We currently support three projects via fiscal sponsorship and are growing an awesome community of technology for the public good projects that span open data, open research, science, peer-to-peer web, and technology for the public good. Central to our mission to bringing people together from different fields to share ideas.</p>\n<p>During the call, we hosted three speakers, updates from our sponsored projects, and non-verbal updates from the community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Karissa McKelvey (one of our fantastic <a href=\"/css-board/\">new board members</a>!!!) and Stephen Whitmore spoke about <a href=\"https://www.digital-democracy.org/\">Digital Democracy</a>. Digital Democracy‚Äôs mission is to empower marginalized communities to use technology to defend their rights. In simple language,they fight for indigenous self-determination through tech &amp; local partnerships. They build tools that work in remote, rural locations that help people defend their land ownership and other rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peter van Hardenberg did a demo of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pvh/pixelpusher-real-time-peer-to-peer-collaboration-with-react-7c7bc8ecbf74\">PixelPusher</a>. An experiment to really understand the limitations and needs for peer-to-peer applications and data sync. You really need to check out his demo! It was pretty cool to see real-time how collaborative conflict resolution can happen on via a peer-to-peer network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tara Vancil covered <a href=\"http://beakerbrowser.com/\">Beaker Browser</a>, a project near and dear to our hearts. If you are following Dat and haven't seen Beaker, you are in for a treat! With Beaker you can browser websites over Dat and so much more! Tara gave some updates and vision of where they are headed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Danielle and Joe did the <a href=\"Datproject.org\">Dat</a> update, calling out recent work on <a href=\"/tags/science/\">Dat in the Lab</a>. Stay tuned for an update to the CLI to address data transfer issues for researchers. The new <a href=\"http://github.com/datprotocol/\">Dat Protocol Working Group</a> is working to formalize existing Dat specification and create processes for updating protocol. This group meets every other Wednesday in #datprotocol IRC - all welcome!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nokome Bentley delivered the <a href=\"https://stenci.la\">Stencila</a> update. Stencila aims to make reproducible research more accessible through familiar word processor and spreadsheet interfaces. Check out the (most recent builds)[<a href=\"http://builds.stenci.la/stencila/\">http://builds.stenci.la/stencila/</a>]. Stencila is also looking to develop function libraries, to make it easier for users to add custom functions and to write domain-specific function libraries that can be used within Stencila. Learn more at the Stencila <a href=\"https://github.com/stencila/libtemplate\">work in progress libtemplate</a>. And finally, on the interoperability front, chek out Stencila's ongoing <a href=\"https://github.com/stencila/convert\">work on converters</a>. Initial working version of converters for Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown to Stencila Articles (so you can port your markdown notebook and code into a JATS-based article format to write up a publication) are just one exciting thing discussed!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ScienceFair's Richard Smith delivered an async update. He's partnered with <a href=\"http://worldbrain.io\">WorldBrain</a> to work on shared distributed knowledge infrastructure issues. In the process, he's developed blazing fast Dat compatible fulltext search index with WorldBrain in pure JS that scales linearly to millions of documents (expect release in the next month - boom! üî•üî•üî•). Major work on ScienceFair datasources is underway, including all of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/\">PMC</a>. This would mean that theree full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature maintiained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM) would be searchable, annotatable, and sharable.

      "title": "Is Open Science ready for software containers?",
      "content_html": "<p>As part of the Dat in the Lab project we are working with different campuses in the University of California network. One of our goals is to publish researcher's data, code, and executable Linux container all as files in a version controlled Dat repository. For this to be useful, a person should be able to execute these Linux environments (aka containers) anywhere.</p>\n<p>If you own your computer, or rent a cloud server, you can use <code>sudo</code> or root access to run containers. Most container systems like Docker expect you to have superuser privileges. In many university computing clusters (aka High-performance computing - &quot;HPC&quot;), hundreds of researchers share a single Linux environment and do not have the ability to install global software packages or execute commands that require <code>sudo</code>. Even workstations and laptops that are owned by an institution often do not allow users these privileges.</p>\n<p>We are working with researchers who want to run a bioinformatics pipeline that was developed at UCLA on the cluster located at University of California, Merced. Both campuses have shared computing clusters running CentOS 7 Linux. However, the clusters are different. The UCLA cluster has thousands of software packages installed. These have been requested over time by UCLA researchers. These packages are not a standard part of the CentOS ecosystem and are not available to easily install at UC Merced.</p>\n<p>The pipeline we are working with requires specific versions of Python, Bash, R and GCC to be installed and compiled. The UC Merced cluster does not have these versions available. The traditional way researchers have dealt with these code portability issues is by asking their cluster sysadmins to install all of the packages they need. Sometimes the sysadmins say no, as upgrading to (for example) Python 3 globally would break all Python 2 applications. Sometimes sysadmins say yes, but it takes a while as this is tedious work.</p>\n<p>To address global upgrade breakages at UCLA they use the <a href=\"http://modules.sourceforge.net/\">Environment Modules</a> system to allow users to load in specific versions of packages into their environment. For example, when you first login to a compute node shell there will be no version of R loaded. But you can run a command like <code>module load R/3.4.2</code> to get a specific version loaded into your path for that specific shell session. The UCLA pipeline we are working with has a series of <code>module load</code> directives executed at the beginning of the pipeline to ensure the correct environment is set up.</p>\n<p>However, moving the pipeline to another cluster requires moving all of the modules as well. Some modules are single binary executables, easy to move to any other server with the same architecture, but others (such as R) are a complicated dependency graph including things like a certain version of an Intel Fortran compiler needed to compile R packages at runtime.</p>\n<p>Moving the pipeline code is easy, but moving the underlying machinery (the specifically compiled and installed software dependencies and overall supporting Linux environment) can be very complicated. The worst part is, even if you seem to get the pipeline to work, there is no way to verify that you installed and compiled everything <em>exactly</em> the same on the new machine as it was installed on the old machine. You can only see if your program works, but there may be subtle bugs lurking that may go undetected due to an environmental difference (e.g. a slightly different C++ compiler being used which throws off the Fortran calculations in an obscure old version of an R package).</p>\n<p>Our initial idea was to simply copy <em>all</em> of the modules from UCLA onto UC Merced, but this proved impossible. Running <code>du -sh</code> would have told us see how big the total installed size of all modules on the UCLA cluster was, but after many hours the command never finished. We needed another approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"containers\">Containers <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#containers\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In theory, containers are a better way to address this problem. Instead of having everyone on a machine share a single Linux environment, containers allow for many environments to execute at the same time. The entire container can be version controlled for reproducibility, giving you cryptographically secure confidence that the code will run the same everywhere. Before we talk about containers, let's run over the basics of Linux.</p>\n<p>Conceptually, Linux is made up of the kernel and user-space. The kernel interfaces with the physical hardware of the computer and presents an API (called system calls or syscalls) to interact with the hardware. Virtual machines (VMs) emulate everything from the hardware up, including the kernel, which provides a complete emulation of an environment but comes at the cost of performance, as your application is using e.g. virtual RAM which has to get mapped to physical RAM through multiple layers of abstraction. For a bioinformatics pipeline that might be designed to use 1TB of RAM, this will reduce performance and defeat the purpose of buying specialized hardware.</p>\n<p>Containers differ from virtualization in that all containers running on one machine share the same kernel, which means they are not emulating any hardware or emulating the kernel. A program like VirtualBox or Xen does not qualify a container, but is rather classified as a VM because they emulate the whole machine. There are many ways to implement a container system depending on what your requirements are. A container system is any program that will use a set of syscalls to run a program in a Linux file system. What syscalls are used determine the security tradeoffs and kernel compatibility. You may have heard the phrase &quot;everything in Linux is a file&quot;. This means that you can simply take a filesystem, throw it in a ZIP archive, and you have a container. How you execute the files as processes depends on which syscalls you use, but a container is essentially just a folder full of files and a way to run a process in that folder.</p>\n<p>By renting a cloud machine, one can pick a distribution with the latest Linux kernel and use <code>sudo</code> without issue. Thereby giving access to every syscall, including the new shiny ones that modern container systems rely on. However researchers using shared university servers don't have control over the kernel and probably don't have <code>sudo</code> access.</p>\n<p>To return to our goals: We want to publish researcher's data, code, and executable Linux container all as files in a version controlled Dat repository. We want anyone to be able to execute these Linux containers anywhere. To do this, it needs to be easy for researchers to set up and maintain containers on university machines without special sysadmin permissions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"possible-solutions\">Possible solutions <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#possible-solutions\">#</a></h3>\n<p>All of that stuff above leads to the real challenge of containers for reproducible science: making containers run everywhere, including restricted shared computing clusters. With that in mind let's look at different approaches to running containers in Linux.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chroot\">chroot <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#chroot\">#</a></h4>\n<p>The <code>chroot</code> syscall is sort of the proto-container. It's been around in Linux forever. In Linux, your filesytem starts at <code>/</code>. Usually a user puts their stuff somewhere like <code>/home/alex</code>. If you unzipped an Ubuntu distribution at <code>/home/alex/ubuntu</code>, you can use <code>chroot</code> to spawn a new process that is running relative to <code>/home/alex/ubuntu</code> but thinks it's at <code>/</code>. At it's most basic form, this lets you 'nest' filesystems and have different processes sharing the same kernel, but using different Linux environments. Using our definition above, this qualifies as a container. The downside is that there is no built-in security preventing things in the chroot from achieving root privileges, and you have to be root to create a chroot.</p>\n<h4 id=\"root-daemon-(docker)\">Root Daemon (Docker) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#root-daemon-(docker)\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Docker runs a daemon process as root that, if you also have root, you can ask to download and boot containers for you. This means that with Docker, containers are executed as the root user. Also by default only other root users can talk to the Docker daemon at all. You can change the security so that users can run Docker without sudo, but this is not recommended by Docker as it means any user can execute root commands (e.g. Docker daemon access basically <a href=\"https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/08/why-we-dont-let-non-root-users-run-docker-in-centos-fedora-or-rhel/\">means root access</a>).</p>\n<p>The advantage of this approach is that it's simple. The Docker daemon manages the lifecycle of all containers running on a system. You use the Docker protocol to talk to the daemon, and the daemon translates that to whatever syscalls are available to it on the kernel it's running on. If you move to a different kernel, the Docker protocol stays the same (in theory, in practice this can break their protocol a lot which defeats the purpose of Docker in our opinion, but that's a different blog post). The downside is that the containers don't run as the user, they run as root. University sysadmins don't like this.</p>\n<h4 id=\"rootless-containers-(runc%2C-charliecloud)\">Rootless containers (runC, Charliecloud) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#rootless-containers-(runc%2C-charliecloud)\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Since Linux Kernel 3.8 you have access to a syscall <code>CLONE_NEWUSER</code> which lets you create an user namespace as an unprivileged user. There's more info in <a href=\"https://www.cyphar.com/blog/post/20160627-rootless-containers-with-runc\">this excellent blog post</a> but the tl;dr is that you can, without <code>sudo</code>, create a process tree that maps your user on the actual system to a virtual user (like root) inside the new process namespace, meaning you can run processes as a &quot;virtual&quot; root without needing root yourself. Unfortunately in CentOS/RHEL user namespaces are <a href=\"https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2015/07/07/whats-next-for-containers-user-namespaces/\">still not enabled</a> by default due to security concerns.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/\">Charliecloud</a> project from Los Alamos has developed a minimal (~900 lines of C) chroot-style container system that is based on having user namespaces enabled.</p>\n<p>CentOS appears to be is the only distribution that doesn't have user namespaces enabled. CentOS also happens to be popular in universities. In the long term, this seems like the best security for containers for shared environments. For now, to support CentOS as well as older servers/kernels, other solutions are still needed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"setuid-(singularity%2C-bubblewrap)\">SetUID (Singularity, Bubblewrap) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#setuid-(singularity%2C-bubblewrap)\">#</a></h4>\n<p>If you don't have a way to do rootless containers, but you don't want to give your researchers root access, then you have to find a middle ground. <a href=\"http://singularity.lbl.gov/\">Singularity</a> is one such approach that works here. To install singularity, you need to be root, so that you can use the <code>setuid</code> syscall to 'mark' the <code>singularity</code> binary executable with root privileges. This means that <code>singularity</code> can do stuff as root, but the user's program cannot. As long as Singularity doesn't have any security exploits it's a nice tradeoff. Once you have Singularity installed, you can run containers without superuser privileges, and the container processes are owned by your user, not running as root.</p>\n<p>Singularity will use user namespaces if they are available instead of <code>setuid</code>, so it works similarly to Docker in that it tries to provide a portal container execution context that works on a variety of new and old Linux distributions, but differs in that it doesn't require a central root daemon process, which makes it more popular with university sysadmins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap\">Bubblewrap</a> is another similar approach that specifically tries to be a minimal setuid-based program that can spawn a container process and de-escalate all other privileges. The goal of bubblewrap is to keep surface area of the program minimal so that it can be audited more effectively, which is a great engineering principle that is (in my opinion) often overlooked. OpenSSL vs. Libsodium comes to mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#conclusion\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It's worth mentioning <a href=\"https://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux\">the article that coined the phrase &quot;containers don't contain&quot;</a> when discussing container security. In the university use case we described, we aren't looking for perfect security, but rather security that fulfills the requirements of university sysadmins.</p>\n<p>So, which of the above approaches are we using at UC Merced? We've put in a request for the sysadmins there to install Singularity, which seems like the best approach since we can't run rootless containers on their CentOS. If they weren't running on CentOS we would probably just use rootless containers, as we could use them without asking the sysadmins to do anything. We'll do another blog post later in the year with more details on exactly what we're building with all this container stuff, but we wanted to take the opportunity here to talk about the scope of the challenge of deploying containers in the open science ecosystem.</p>\n",

",
      "content_html": "<p>Privacy on the web is an elusive thing. We often think our data is private only to later learn the company we trusted is using it for something we find unsavory (or it gets hacked and released en masse). In our view, this is one of the central shortcomings of the current system ‚Äî centralized services are the <em>only</em> option for communities. This forces us to trust these services with our data, even if we do not want to or do not know how they are using it. For many, they view this as the cost of life online (which is now all but required for life offline). But it does not need to be.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/dont-ship/\">a recent post</a>, we shared questions we ask before shipping software. Part of the post raised privacy concerns around hosting Wikipedia on Dat. Many people in our community asked: what does this mean for privacy on Dat in general? Should I be worried!? These are great questions! And thank you for keeping us accountable.</p>\n<p>We apologize for raising these points and not addressing all of them (the last post was getting a bit long!). You can read more about <a href=\"/reader-privacy-on-the-p2p-web/\">reader privacy models</a> specific to hosting large public datasets (like Wikipedia); this post will address how Dat privacy currently works and what we can do better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trust-someone\">Trust Someone <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#trust-someone\">#</a></h2>\n<p>To live in this world we need to trust people (I will try to keep this grounded in reality and back to privacy soon!). When we get in a car, we trust other drivers to follow the rules. We trust that the planners and engineers did their job correctly. We trust the mechanic and car designers thought about our safety. If not, we trust our government to hold people accountable. We cannot engage in social life without trust.</p>\n<p>The same is true for life online. There are two questions you have to answer when thinking about trust and privacy online:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who am I trusting?</li>\n<li>What information am I trusting them with?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if you post on Facebook, you are trusting the company and employees of Facebook with your data. You are also trusting the people you have added as friends to not share your data. This feels strange because we have two very different groups to trust. On one hand, you have a community of friends where you have some measure of how much to trust them. On the other, you have to extend trust to Facebook without much to substantiate that trust (beyond our democratic institutions and social or economic pressures).</p>\n<p><em>(There are systems that aim to minimize trust, such as Tor or blockchain systems. While these do allow for less trust, they also have other negative trade-offs. In order to decrease trust, you have to make the system more complex and slower. We seek to find a balance where users can decide on how much complexity they want for their security needs (you can use Dat over Tor!). For example, we want to trust the local public library without needing to connect via Tor or use a blockchain to checkout a book.)</em></p>\n<p>To us, the question is not: how can we remove all trust from the system? Trust is human. The question is: <strong>how can we create communities where we can choose who to trust and with what information?</strong> Right now we are forced to opt-in to trusting organizations to connect online. We strive to make that optional, more explicit, and more flexible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"foundation-of-dat-privacy\">Foundation of Dat Privacy <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#foundation-of-dat-privacy\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The foundation of Dat privacy rests on private-by-default and end-to-end encryption for all metadata and content. Whenever you create and share information over Dat, only other users you <strong>explicitly share</strong> that information with can see it. There is no way other users can discover what you are sharing. This is as true for a &quot;public&quot; dat site and a private dat you are sharing with one person.</p>\n<p>The second point, which we raised in the Wikipedia post, is how and when your IP address gets shared. This is where things get confusing because it depends on who you are connecting to and how you are connecting (and also where we can most improve documentation and implementation). We'll dive into different examples of how these work in practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-privacy-examples\">Dat Privacy Examples <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-privacy-examples\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"private-peer-to-peer\">Private Peer-to-Peer <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#private-peer-to-peer\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The simplest example, and default state for Dat, is private peer-to-peer sharing. In this case, we can imagine Joe wants to share some food pictures with Danielle. They discover each other using DNS and connect directly. No one else can see their IP addresses or Joes's food pictures. All metadata and content is private and encrypted in transit.</p>\n<p>Key points in this example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Private Dat sharing has world class privacy (encrypted, no third-parties)</li>\n<li>Users sharing a common Dat trust other connections with your logs. Not all applications need a large pool of peers, as in our Wikipedia example.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"community-peer-to-peer\">Community Peer-to-Peer <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#community-peer-to-peer\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Sharing data with a community of peers is a feature unique to Dat. It is a feature impossible to mimic on how the web works today. This is somewhere in between BitTorrent (global peer-to-peer) and one-to-one connections (client-server or direct peer-to-peer). As the network grows, we have to start being a bit more careful about the privacy implications.</p>\n<p>In this example, I create a feed to share on <a href=\"https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client\">Rotonde</a>, a decentralized social network. When I share that key with my friends, they can re-share my feed. Similarly to how we trust our friends with Facebook data, we may be trusting our friends to keep the information private. (However, we can start to add more complexity when privacy needs to be guaranteed, with trade-offs).</p>\n<p>These communities can be organized socially (sharing with friends I know IRL) or more organically as we've seen with Rotonde, where connections of connections start sharing feeds. Thus, trust in this situation becomes a people problem, in other words ‚Äî messy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-data\">Public Data <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#public-data\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When considering publicly shared data, the chief concern is reader privacy (since we can assume that the data is okay to share widely). The two aspects of reader privacy are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who can see what IP addresses are in the swarm?</li>\n<li>Can users in the swarm see specifically what content other users are requesting?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Concerns about sharing IP addresses may warrant its own post, as they become quite nuanced. IP addresses publicly identify your computer on a network. Whenever you connect to a website, they can view your IP address (and many analytics services store them). We want to minimize access to IP addresses and will continue to improve here. However, we need to be most careful in leaking IP addresses where there may be other surveillance or censorship concerns (such as in the Wikipedia example). Here again, we have to balance complexity and difficulty of use with common use cases ‚Äî and maintain privacy in situations where it may be paramount.</p>\n<p>The second question, of whether users can see what content is being requested, is similar to the difference between HTTPS and HTTP. Without HTTPS sites, ISPs (or other middlemen) can see exactly what page of <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org\">wikipedia.org</a> you request, whereas with HTTPS they only see a connection to <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org\">wikipedia.org</a>. Our <a href=\"/reader-privacy-on-the-p2p-web/\">reader privacy on the p2p web</a> post covers all the nuances, but we'll address some key points here.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dat-with-%22old-web%22-security\">Dat with &quot;Old Web&quot; Security <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-with-%22old-web%22-security\">#</a></h4>\n<p>The first point is that Dat can <strong>always</strong> be at least as secure as the &quot;old web.&quot; That is, trusting one centralized organization with IP logs and information about what users are requesting.</p>\n<p>Dat can be used over HTTP to act as a traditional web service (with the added benefit of having versioned websites and verifying content isn't corrupted between the source and the user). We can also have applications that connect to trusted peers directly, mimicking a client-server model but over the peer-to-peer network.</p>\n<h4 id=\"peer-to-peer\">Peer-to-Peer <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#peer-to-peer\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Public data with peer-to-peer distribution will be most useful in cases where we need to distribute bandwidth. As before, we can continue to increase complexity to add more privacy (see reader privacy post for more):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get data from a trusted sets of peers, i.e. Web of Trust.</li>\n<li>Make it more difficult for single users to &quot;win&quot; discovery, ensuring a more unique distribution of peers in each swarm.</li>\n<li>Mask content requests by adding in noise, making it harder to identify requested content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"protocol-options\">Protocol Options <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#protocol-options\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Beyond different peer-to-peer models, we can start using different protocols. Dat gives users control over how to discover &amp; connect to peers, giving more flexibility compared to the existing web. For example, you can run Dat in an offline network where all connections stay in the local network. This flexibility is what allows us to run Dat over HTTP connections.</p>\n<p>Being protocol agnostic allows for more flexibility in security models. But with this customization we also have make sure security and privacy implications of different implementations are clear, an area we can really improve on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-we-can-improve\">Where We Can Improve <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#where-we-can-improve\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thinking through this post and the questions we got, we see a few areas we can definitely improve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve our DHT module so IP addresses are more secure</li>\n<li>Provide option to opt-out of peer-to-peer for public data applications (i.e. use the web's traditional trust model)</li>\n<li>Demonstrate how Dat over HTTP or other &quot;old web&quot; and trusted peer models can work via Dat.</li>\n<li>Improve transparency! Make nice pictures that show how things work; this stuff is complicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most importantly, we can talk about privacy and security more! We can ask hard questions. This is an area we feel the old web really falls short and we are still building models for how this can work in the future. The balance will always be between complexity, speed, usability, and privacy. We want to be able to shift this balance as necessary for different applications but always make it clear what the trade-offs are.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the community for bringing up the privacy questions. Let us know if you have more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dat_project\">on Twitter</a> or our <a href=\"http://chat.datproject.org/\">chatroom</a>.</p>\n",

Max has published an independent <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180103192859/https://medium.com/@maxogden/statement-to-the-community-c8356dbdd392\">personal statement</a> about his actions. Max has resigned from all leadership positions. His public community involvement and access to project communication channels will be restricted while we evaluate his long-term involvement in the project. We decided on these actions through discussions with the CSS board (from which Max recused himself), the Dat community, and external advisors.</p>\n<p><em>The Code for Science &amp; Society board has also conducted an independent inquiry, we've posted it at <a href=\"http://codeforscience.org/static/CSSBoard-MO.pdf\">codeforscience.org</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Immediate Actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Max has stepped down from leadership of Dat project.</li>\n<li>Max has agreed to remove himself from public Dat communication including IRC, Github, and Twitter for three months, with reinstatement pending evaluation by Dat community leaders and external advisors.</li>\n<li>Max has resigned as Executive Director of CSS. Danielle Robinson, PhD and Joe Hand will share the Executive Director role for 3 months, with oversight from the CSS board.</li>\n<li>Max will step down from the CSS board and has recused himself from conversations on his position.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moving forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Max‚Äôs future involvement in the project will be evaluated through monthly evaluation by Dat‚Äôs community leaders. These leaders may call on external advisors during this process.</li>\n<li>To preserve continuity, Max will contribute to the documentation of existing modules, hand-off ownership of existing repositories, and ensure any other relevant information is documented.</li>\n<li>Mathias Buus, Dat lead developer, will take on a Technical Advisor role at CSS.</li>\n<li>Max will complete ongoing work with the Dat in the Lab project, under the supervision of interim CSS co-Executive Director Danielle Robinson, who is the Partnerships Director on that project.</li>\n<li>In partnership with external and community advisors, we will re-evaluate Max‚Äôs involvement in Dat and CSS after a year, contingent on demonstrating continued commitment to the Dat project Code of Conduct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Danielle Robinson, PhD, Director of Partnerships at CSS, and Joe Hand, Director of Operations at CSS, will act as interim co-Executive Directors for three months while we establish a governance structure for Dat and formalize the organizational structure of CSS with the goal of sustainability for both Dat and CSS. Danielle and Joe have both been involved with Dat for over a year and each bring unique expertise in organizational and community strategy that will help the Dat community come forward. You can read more about Danielle and Joe on the <a href=\"https://datproject.org/about\">Dat Team page</a>. We are addressing this issue transparently as a community to continue fostering a welcoming and effective project.</p>\n<p>We want to ensure everyone in our community is comfortable and safe. We want to know when community members feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Abusive behavior causes serious harm to others and is not acceptable in our community. In line with our values, we will be open and honest about how our team is working through this process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps-for-dat-governance\">Next Steps for Dat Governance <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#next-steps-for-dat-governance\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This experience has pushed us to fast-track development of our team and project governance. We also identified an urgent issue: our project never instituted a project-level Code of Conduct. We‚Äôve drafted a Code of Conduct, it is open for <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/Code-of-Conduct\">public comment on Github</a>. Through this experience we hope to grow a more inclusive and introspective community while prioritizing our Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>In accordance with our goals as a project, we want to ensure work can continue without reliance on any single individual. We are building something to last a long time and our structure will reflect that. During the next three months we will develop governance structure for Dat, alongside CSS, in line with those goals. We will be transparent about this process and will develop governance for Dat in collaboration with our community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-approach-to-personal-accountability\">Our Approach to Personal Accountability <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#our-approach-to-personal-accountability\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Where possible, we want to encourage growth and accountability. Max has demonstrated a willingness to address the issues that lead to this situation, and to make a commitment to personal growth. We want to support him in that endeavor. However, we have to make sure he understands his responsibilities and that his behaviour will not negatively impact our community or others in the future. To do this we will put in place accountability practices for this process and future events (to be included in our Code of Conduct).</p>\n<p>We will continue to use this framework in situations involving a community member implicated in abusive or harmful behavior, even if this happens outside of the sphere of Dat community activity. If you have concerns of questions about this process, please reach out to us. You can DM Danielle Robinson (@daniellecrobins, dcrobins - IRC), Joe Hand (@joeahand, jhand - IRC), or email both of us (<a href=\"mailto:community@datproject.org\">community@datproject.org</a>). We want to ensure our community members are comfortable continuing to engage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback-%26-questions\">Feedback &amp; Questions <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#feedback-%26-questions\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Please get in touch if you have feedback or questions (<a href=\"mailto:community@datproject.org\">community@datproject.org</a> - sent to Danielle and Joe).

      "content_html": "<p><em>&quot;Is there a Dat Wikipedia mirroring project?&quot;</em> We got this question from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/939340309011382272\">@hundredrabbits on Twitter</a>. Distributing Wikipedia over a peer-to-peer network is an awesome idea and perfect use case for Dat. But Max‚Äôs answer was revealing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was [building it], then stopped while trying to figure out how to p2p host Wikipedia without sacrificing reader privacy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We did not ship it.</p>\n<p>Between us and our community, we think of lots of neat or useful things that could be built on Dat. Along with mirroring Wikipedia ‚Äî a public Dat peer, cloud hosting for Dat, and a public Dat to HTTP proxy would all be great demos and extremely useful for getting more users on Dat. But we did not ship any of them.</p>\n<p>Why don‚Äôt we ship it? Do we not want to move fast? What about acquiring users!?</p>\n<h2 id=\"decisions%2C-morality%2C-and-scale\">Decisions, Morality, and Scale <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#decisions%2C-morality%2C-and-scale\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Technology is powerful. We are connected globally at a scale and speed that a few decades ago seemed impossible. But with that scale and speed, small decisions can have powerful impacts.</p>\n<p>Decisions are a tricky thing. It is easy to make many small decisions without considering where it will lead you. Often, you cannot not know where it will lead you. In organizations, this becomes even more difficult. The bureaucracy present in all organizations, from our 5 person team to Walmart's 2.1 million employees, shapes how we make our daily decisions. In <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Mazes\">Moral Mazes</a></em>, Robert Jackall shows how small ethical dilemmas are routinely ignored in business decisions for the benefit of the organization, individuals, or to appease a manager.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, those decisions can lead us down unexpected paths. And in technology companies they add up quickly. As put beautifully in the Zebra manifesto:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>business models breed behavior, and at scale, that behavior can lead to far-reaching, sometimes destructive outcomes.</p>\n<p><em><small><a href=\"https://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebrasfix-c467e55f9d96\">Zebras Fix What Unicorns Break</a></small></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"first-order-decisions-are-easy\">First-Order Decisions Are Easy <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#first-order-decisions-are-easy\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Destructive outcomes often do not result immediately from decisions. They are result of the second- and third-order effects of one decision or many small decisions combined or made repeatedly (often because of a business model or bureaucratic system). The 2008 housing crisis is a prime example of this; many decisions were based on the assumption that housing prices would always rise. Few people examined the high-order effects of their decisions around that assumption.</p>\n<p>Making decisions based on first-order effects is easy:</p>\n<p><em>Q: Do I want to eat that chocolate chip cookie?</em><br>\n<em>A: Yes, that sounds freaking delicious.</em></p>\n<p><em>Q: Do I want to exercise right now?</em><br>\n<em>A: No, I will get sweaty and tired.</em></p>\n<p>Decisions become hard when you consider the second- and third-order effects. Second- and third-order effects means answering the questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What outcomes or impacts does this decision have beyond the immediate result?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>What impacts does this have if this decision is made repeatedly (as is often the case in bureaucratic processes)?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at our decisions based on higher-order effects changes things:</p>\n<p><em>Q: Do I want to eat that chocolate chip cookie?</em><br>\n<em>A: If I always eat a cookie when I want one it may be delicious now, but my stomach will not feel good and I may gain weight. (I really like chocolate chip cookies)</em></p>\n<p><em>Q: Do I want to exercise right now?</em><br>\n<em>A: If I exercise right now I‚Äôll be tired, but it will make me feel better tomorrow and if I do it regularly I will be healthier.</em></p>\n<p>Looking beyond the first-order consequences we can see whether exercise or eating a cookie is a positive or negative decision. These other effects are often delayed, indirectly related, or a result of making the same decision repeatedly. For example, exercise done often can make your brain function better! Bet you do not think about that when trying to decide if you want to get tired and sweaty. When we think about building something or providing a service to users, we have to think both about the immediate benefit and the unintended or long-term implications.</p>\n<p>Beyond first-order questions, we are interested in how shipping something will impact our ability to solve hard problems in the long-term. We are not building software to make money and exit as soon as possible. We are not building to grow as quickly as possible. We recognize solving big problems takes time, deliberation, and making hard decisions. To do so in a sustainable way, as a non-profit, forces us to make concessions. Before we ship, we need to ask ourselves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will this require us to make future decisions we do not want to make?</li>\n<li>Does this force us to spend more time supporting users that are not related to our primary goals?</li>\n<li>If we ship this, will we be able to finance it long-term? If not, how will users be negatively impacted if we shut it down?</li>\n<li>Does this have implications for user-data privacy? Can we protect against that with our current resources?</li>\n<li>Will we have to enforce copyrights and monitor for abuse or illegal use? If so, do we have the resources to do that?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is obvious risk in not shipping. Another similar technology or company may gain market-share and get all the users that want peer-to-peer data software. If they solve the hard problems that we are trying to solve in a sustainable and mutualistic way, then great, we are done! If they did not solve the hard problems or <a href=\"/dat-commons/\">enclosed the market</a> for profit, we will keep working.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-ship-wikipedia-on-dat%3F\">Why Not Ship Wikipedia on Dat? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#why-not-ship-wikipedia-on-dat%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/reader-privacy-on-the-p2p-web/\">Reader privacy</a> is one of the hardest (ethical) parts of a peer-to-peer system. Distributing Wikipedia over a peer-to-peer system means that any user can surveil the IP addresses of other users and, depending on how it is distributed, even identify what pages they are requesting. For us, this is an unacceptable first-order effect.</p>\n<p>The impact of this first-order surveillance problem leads us to even more concerning questions about the second- and third-order impacts of that decision.</p>\n<p>Who will be tracking these IP addresses, and what else will they do with them? Do users know this is a risk and are they protecting themselves? Will this lead to censorship of Dat discovery servers (which enable peers to connect) or Dat-related work, making any future work, which may have greater impact, even more difficult?</p>\n<p>These are some of the questions we know to ask. But what about the questions that we do not consider? Those questions will likely contain possibilities for the even more disastrous outcomes. Until we can answer the questions we know, and understand the questions we do not know, we cannot see what decisions this will require in the future.</p>\n<p>Yes, Wikipedia on Dat would be great. But will it prevent us from solving harder problems in the future? Will we be spending resources that should be spent elsewhere? What decisions will we be forced to make in the future because of this? We cannot predict everything in the future, but without answering these questions the organization may be forced down an unwanted path.</p>\n<p>We will not ship Wikipedia on Dat, yet.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Max for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/denormalize/status/939347409124990976\">tweet inspiration</a> and huge thanks the <a href=\"https://www.zebrasunite.com/\">Zebra movement</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zeynep\">Zeynep Tufekci</a> for asking hard questions about the tech industry.</em></p>\n",

      "title": "Virtualizing environments for eDNA analysis",
      "content_html": "<p>Last month we introduced on this blog the research groups at <a href=\"/dat-in-the-lab-ucdavis-1/\">UC Davis</a> and <a href=\"/uc-merced-1/\">UC Merced</a> that we'll be working with for the <a href=\"/dat-in-the-lab/\">Dat in the Lab project</a>. Read on to hear where this project is taking us (hint in the header photo).</p>\n<p>Discussions with these research groups have highlighted the need for easy reproducible research environments.  Researchers often need to run another group's analysis pipeline, but software dependencies can turn this seemingly simple task into a long process. Every university has a different computing environment on their local clusters. Another side of this issue is that research groups need to archive pipelines so that future group members can use and learn from them. To address this issue, we've been developing Dat Container to create customizable versioned environments.</p>\n<p>Through the Dawson Lab at UC Merced, we were introduced to the exciting <a href=\"http://www.ucedna.com/\">CALeDNA program</a> run by the University of California Conservation Genomics Consortium. This initiative seeks mobilize citizen scientists to collect eDNA samples to monitor California's biodiversity.</p>\n<p>What's eDNA? eDNA stands for environmental DNA and it refers to DNA collected from soil, sand, water, or other material that will reflect organisms that have been through the place where the sample was taken. Every organism sheds cells and every cell contains DNA, DNA can be collected in from the cells an organism leaves behind in the environment.</p>\n<p>For most traditional genetic or genomic analysis, DNA samples are collected directly from an organism's saliva, hair, skin, or other cells. We can use eDNA to scale up genetic analysis from individuals to entire communities by non-invasively collecting environmental samples. These environmental samples should contain eDNA from all of the organisms that pass through an environment. This allows us to monitor the diversity of animals, plants, fungi, and prokaryotes without the need to individually sample each organism. This works particularly well for monitoring hard to capture, endangered, and cryptic species. For more on eDNA, start <a href=\"http://www.ucedna.com/what-is-environmental-dna/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/cal-eDNA.jpg\" alt=\"cal-eDNA\"> <em>CALeDNA citizen science sample collection.</em></p>\n<p>Are you based in California? You can take part - learn more about the CALeDNA citizen science program <a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/be-a-citizen-scientist-and-help-preserve-californias-biodiversity\">here</a>. Volunteers get training, a sample collection kit, a phone app to guide their documentation of California's rich biodiversity, and bragging rights.</p>\n<p>Our use-case for this pilot is UC Merced postdoctoral researcher Dannise V. Ruiz-Ramos, who wants to use an eDNA pipeline developed at UCLA on the UC Merced cluster to analyze DNA from soil samples. She is interested in estimating biodiversity and detecting threatened or endangered species in vernal pools in UC Merced grassland reserve. At UCLA, postdoctoral researcher <a href=\"https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/person/emily-curd/\">Emily Curd</a> (along with a all-star team including graduate students Gaurav Kandlikar, Zack Gold, and Rachel Turba, post-doc Baochen Shi, Executive Director of the UC Conservation Genomics Consortium Rachel Meyer, and software engineer Jesse Gomer) developed a software pipeline to process and assign taxonomy to genetic material collected in eDNA samples for the CALeDNA program.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/UCLA-campus-selfiestick-resize.jpeg\" alt=\"UCLA-campus-selfiestick-resize\"> <em>Janns Steps and Royce Hall on the beautiful UCLA campus.</em></p>\n<p>This pipeline runs on the <a href=\"https://idre.ucla.edu/hoffman2\">Hoffman2</a> computing cluster. The pipeline developed by Dr. Curd and her team calls on the local versions R, Perl, Python, and Anaconda and many other software packages installed on Hoffman2. When Dr. Ruiz-Ramos attempts to run the pipeline on the UC Merced cluster, she needs to run it in an environment with the exact same versions of the each software package. Getting this sorted out usually takes cluster teams and research teams at both institutions working together and generally takes weeks to months.</p>\n<p>Our approach is to develop an container-based emulation of the Hoffman2 cluster that can run on any machine. By creating a container that includes the complete software environment of Hoffman2, researchers across the UC system and beyond can quickly get Hoffman2-based analysis pipelines up and running.</p>\n<p>To do this, we are working with <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh\">Mathias Buus</a> to develop <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/dat-container\">Dat Container</a>, which will version control containerized research environments along with data and code. Researchers will be able to visit <a href=\"https://datbase.org/\">Datbase</a> to download a containerized computing environment specific to [the pipeline they want to run]. Researchers can then run [pipeline of interest] on their local computing cluster, in the cloud, or on a laptop without the hassle of installing multiple software packages. By emulating the Hoffman2 environment, we'll help researchers save time and effort. To facilitate archiving the work, a Dat Container can be stored along with data and code. Our goal is to create an reproducible research environment that can be archived, accessed when needed without hassle, and shared with collaborators. This pilot will lay the foundation for us to build out Dat Container as a solution for researchers looking to share and archive research environments.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, making it easier to replicate bioinfomatic analysis will help the CALeDNA project become accessible to citizen science groups and other collaborators outside the UC system. Over here in Dat land, we are big fans of the CALeDNA program. We hope that our work on Dat Container will allow people outside universities to play with real scientific analysis pipelines and data!</p>\n<p><em>Magical header photo of downtown LA with a marine layer by Max Ogden, from a plane, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\">CC0</a>.</em></p>\n",

But you can easily tweak this workflow to backup any set of files or folders you want.</p>\n<p>Note: This is written from the perspective of a Mac OS user, so if you're on Windows some of these steps might not make much sense, but it <em>should</em> all work.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Dat and Monu</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You'll need to install <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a>, we recommend the LTS version. Once that's done, you should be able to open up Terminal.app and run <code>npm install dat -g</code>. You might need to put <code>sudo</code> in front if you get a permissions error. To check that you have <code>dat</code> installed, simply type <code>dat</code> and you should see something like this:.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-4.07.40-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-4.07.40-PM\"></p>\n<p>Next you'll need a copy of the <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/monu/releases\">Monu menubar application</a>. This is a program I wrote that runs a set of processes for you in the background. Unzip it and put it in your <code>/Applications</code> folder, then right click &gt; Open it to launch it. When running, it should look like a pair of glasses in your Menubar. You can add it to your Login Items in System Preferences if you want it to boot all your processes on boot.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Configure Dat and Monu</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Terminal, <code>cd</code> into your Desktop and run <code>pwd</code> to print the current path. It should be something like <code>/Users/max/Desktop</code>. Then run this command, but replace the path with your path:</p>\n<pre><code>dat share /Users/max/Desktop --ignore='!**/Screen Shot*.png' --ignore='**/**'\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a <code>.dat</code> folder on your Desktop, and starts to monitor your Desktop for any Screen Shots. You can tweak the first <code>--ignore</code> as well as the path to select which files to match. If you take off both the <code>--ignore</code> arguments it will simply upload everything. The ignore commands are currently a little confusing, but we're working on making this kind of workflow easier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-4.19.37-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-4.19.37-PM\"></p>\n<p>Above is this command running on my computer (I have a lot of Screen Shots on my Desktop). Note I have removed my secret Dat link, to make sure nobody can download my Screen Shots except me :)</p>\n<p>Once you have it working in the Terminal, hit <code>CTRL+C</code> to exit the share process, and let's move on to getting it set it up to run automatically using Monu. Open Monu and click on 'Open Config Folder', and then open the <code>config.json</code> file in a text editor and add an entry like this:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;logs&quot;: &quot;./logs&quot;,\n  &quot;pids&quot;: &quot;./pids&quot;,\n  &quot;processes&quot;: {\n    &quot;dat-desktop-png&quot;: &quot;dat share /Users/max/Desktop --ignore='!**/Screen Shot*.png' --ignore='**/**'&quot;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can name the process anything you want, I just happened to call mine <code>dat-desktop-png</code>. On the right side, make sure you paste the exact command you had working correctly from the Terminal (Don't use <code>/max/</code> in your path if you are copy pasting!).</p>\n<p>As soon as you save the <code>config.json</code> you can open Monu again and you should see this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-4.24.42-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-4.24.42-PM\"></p>\n<p>If you click on it, and click <code>Start</code>, and then go back, It should show up as green and say <code>Running</code>. This means the same Dat process you were running a minute ago in the Terminal is now running in the background, managed by Monu. The logs for this are stored in the same Config folder in case you want to see what output the process has produced.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Sync your data somewhere!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On another computer, take the Dat link that was printed out in your Terminal when you first ran <code>dat share</code> (you can <code>cd ~/Desktop</code> and run <code>dat link</code> if you need it again) and run: <code>dat clone &lt;your-link-here&gt;</code>. If you just wanna try it out on one machine, you can clone your Dat into a different folder.</p>\n<p>To back up in real-time run <code>dat sync</code> in the remote location after the initial clone. As long as you are running <code>dat sync</code> and <code>dat share</code> in two places, any new Screen Shots will be synced in real time and backed up. You can test this by monitoring the two folders, and then taking a screen shot with <code>CMD+SHIFT+4</code>. It should show up on your Desktop first, then shortly in the remote folder.</p>\n<p>To stop syncing, simply open Monu and stop the Dat process. Later, to resume syncing where it left off, start it again.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Store all previous versions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead of using <code>dat sync</code> on the remote end, consider setting up an instance of <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore-archiver-bot\">hypercore-archiver-bot</a>, an IRC bot that you can tell to automatically sync and seed a Dat repository. The advantage of the bot is that it stores all old versions of data as well, not just the latest files (which is how the Dat CLI currently works). We have a bot set up to join our Slack via IRC, so that anyone in our Slack can mirror their Dats on a server with lots of storage.</p>\n<p>We're still working on making this stuff easier. Let us know if you have improvements we can make to this use case!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>This week the <a href=\"https://github.com/codeforscience/Dat-in-the-Lab\">Dat in the Lab</a> team was hosted by the <a href=\"http://library.ucmerced.edu/digital-curation-and-scholarship\">UC Merced Library</a> for a visit to <a href=\"http://mnd.ucmerced.edu/\">Mike Dawson‚Äôs</a> lab. We learned about jellyfish in Palau‚Äôs marine lakes (more <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoBIgoAxlMQ\">here</a>), <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/160524-starfish-baby-boom-surprises-biologists/\">sea star wasting disease</a>, and an exciting environmental DNA (eDNA) project (part of <a href=\"http://www.ucedna.com/\">CALeDNA</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/49tXn.jpeg\" alt=\"49tXn\"> <em>Mike Dawson describes differences in fish found in Palau's marine lakes</em>.</p>\n<p>Researchers in Dawson‚Äôs lab manage a collection of physical specimens (such as preserved jellyfish collected on research trips), extracted DNA and other raw material from samples, as well as genomic data in various stages of processing and annotation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/Palau-Dawson.jpg\" alt=\"Palau-Dawson\"> <em>The Dawson Lab collects samples in the field with the <a href=\"http://coralreefpalau.org/research/marine-lakes/marine-lakes-research/\">Coral Reef Research Foundation</a> and our collaborators Herwig Stibor, Philippe Pondaven, and Stephan Behl from Munich (Germany) &amp; Brest (France). For more pictures from the Dawson Lab, check out <a href=\"http://mnd.ucmerced.edu/Gallery/Gallery.html\">their photo gallery</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The samples come back to the lab, where DNA can be extracted and processed to generate raw DNA sequences that are used in barcoding, population genomics, and the basis of an annotated genome (samples are stored in some impressively organized -20 C freezers).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0003810-DSC01663-1.jpg\" alt=\"0003810-DSC01663-1\"> <em>Impressive freezers!</em></p>\n<p>The raw sequence data are then input into analysis pipelines to investigate phylogenomics, community ecology, and population genomics in marine species. In the Dawson lab, a researcher may participate in all of these processes through their time in the lab - seeing a dataset from specimen collection to annotated genome. In other words, a single researcher may manage both physical collections and diverse data types representing all points of the research lifecycle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/tVrJy.jpeg\" alt=\"tVrJy\"> <em>Rare plastic Orca sighting in the Dawson Lab.</em></p>\n<p>We met with lab members to discuss their research processes and uncover obstacles and concerns relating to data publishing and data management. Through these conversations, reproducible research computing environments emerged as a challenge for many of the researchers. A research computing environment refers to the operating system, software versions, packages, and other dependencies that are specific to the analysis environment on a specific computer or cluster. A pipeline is a series of data transformation or analysis tools linked together. In genomic research, pipelines are used to take raw data and produce an annotated sequence through a series of (theoretically) reproducible steps.</p>\n<p>While details of a computing environment may be published with an analysis pipeline or publication, running another group's pipeline or incorporating parts of a published pipeline is not always straightforward. Researchers in the Dawson lab want to run pipelines from other groups easily, and they want to package up their pipeline for data transformation, analysis, and annotation so that it can be easily run by other groups. The analysis pipelines themselves are research outputs.  Any improvement in documentation and reusability of these resources will enhance the impact of the research by improving the ability of others to use the pipeline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/BFoH4.jpeg\" alt=\"BFoH4\"> <em><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zgwjck8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Dannise V. Ruiz-Ramos</a> described the pipeline she is working with to annotate the sea star genome.</em></p>\n<p>In our meeting with Mike Dawson, he raised the issue of continuity in a research group. How does a group leader handle it when several students or postdocs all get amazing jobs within the same year? Running a group that supports PhD and postdoctoral training positions means that people will move on. When a person leaves one research group, the institutional knowledge they have accrued goes with them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0003810-DSC01697.jpg\" alt=\"0003810-DSC01697\"></p>\n<p>From the perspective of the group leader, it is important to capture as much of that knowledge as possible and use it to smoothly onboard new group members. Data management is critical in this process, but capturing the research computing environment (and other aspects of workflow not typically thought of as data) are just as critical as the raw datasets and physical specimens. Well documented, reproducible pipelines will save the group time effort and provide training for new group members.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0003810-DSC01670.jpg\" alt=\"0003810-DSC01670\"> <em>Unlovable samples will be dealt with.</em></p>\n<p>What can Dat do to make bioinformatics pipelines more reproducible? Dat enables data version control. All the information that describes a research computing environment is data, but giving a researcher a text file detailing the software and operating system does not guarantee that the researcher will be able to reproduce the environment. Can Dat take some of the work out of this? Can we leverage this Dat‚Äôs data version control to create containerized virtual environments, building on our <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/dat-container\">dat-container</a> prototype? While a full solution of the reproducible research environment issue may not be possible in the term of this project, we are actively pursuing this problem and will see where it takes us.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0003810-DSC01702.jpg\" alt=\"0003810-DSC01702\"> <em>After meeting with research group members, we took in the sights of Merced.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0003811-DSC01719.jpg\" alt=\"0003811-DSC01719\"> <em>Library staff joined the Dawson lab for the Dat tutorial.</em></p>\n<p>The next morning, the UC Merced Library hosted a workshop on Dat (<a href=\"https://try-dat.com\">try it at home</a>). The goal of the workshop is to take participants through basic Dat functionality and spark discussion on potential features. Thanks to our UC Davis beta-testers, the UC Merced workshop was a bug-free experience.  Like the group at <a href=\"/dat-in-the-lab-ucdavis-1/\">UC Davis</a>, researchers expressed an interest in multi-writer functionality to allow multiple people to author a datset. We also discussed archiving the lab‚Äôs data, the point at which a lab may not reasonably be able to store all versions of all datasets, and how to make data versioning decisions when working analysis pipelines.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0003811-DSC01725.jpg\" alt=\"0003811-DSC01725\"> <em>Emily Lin, Head of <a href=\"http://library.ucmerced.edu/digital-curation-and-scholarship\">Digital Curation and Scholarship</a>, toured the Dat team around the UC Merced Library, including a stop in the spectacular McFadden-Willis Reading Room.</em></p>\n<p>This visit underscored for us that focusing on researcher workflows and feedback is critical for us. We have learned so much from the visits to UC Davis and Merced. The feedback from researchers has already influenced our priorities. What will we learn over the next year as we continue to work with these researchers? Stay tuned for more detailed posts on the initial projects that we are pursuing at each institution over the next few weeks. Thanks to everyone at UC Merced for a productive visit!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0003811-DSC01713.jpg\" alt=\"0003811-DSC01713\"> <em>UC Merced campus visible in the distance across the fields.</em></p>\n",

Starting today, the <a href=\"http://datproject.org\">Dat Project</a> website will shift to emphasize the open Dat Protocol and our community, with continued support from our nonprofit, Code for Science &amp; Society. We want everyone to use Dat!</p>\n<p><strong>The Dat Project imagines a future of the internet created by global communities on open and secure protocols. Imagine it with us.</strong></p>\n<p>The web is becoming locked inside monopoly-owned platforms, risking user-data privacy, providing surveillance tools, and stifling the flow of public knowledge. Even in communities seeking to contribute and share public data, the technical boundaries of legacy protocols and privatized infrastructure make it impossible. Developers who want to create change are hindered by similar problems, as our team has experienced while building innovative open data tools.</p>\n<p>After years of iteration and user feedback, compelled by our needs for public data sharing, we created a new and open protocol ‚Äî <a href=\"http://datproject.org/paper\">the Dat Protocol</a>. The Dat Protocol builds on our experiences in public data archiving, research data management, and distributed file sharing. Modeled after the best parts of Git, BitTorrent, and the Internet, we created a peer-to-peer protocol for syncing files and data across distributed networks. With built-in encryption, private-by-default data, and wide interoperability, we believe the Dat protocol can &quot;lock the web open&quot; [^1].</p>\n<p>Creating a new public commons requires human-centered technology with a strong community backing. We must empower an inclusive community that aims to create fair, user-focused applications in order to be successful. We believe that not-for-profit and community-driven public technology infrastructure will be the future of the open web. The Dat community has begun to realize that future and we want to give them all the support we can.</p>\n<p>Dat Project started with a new vision for open data and it will continue to be central to our mission.

We will be back.</p>\n<p>We started the day off talking to Nick about his research workflows and the local data infrastructure. After getting the lay of the land at the Center for Watershed Sciences, we visited the <a href=\"http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/\">Data Science Initiative</a> (DSI) at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>UC Davis‚Äôs DSI is run by an interdisciplinary team with a mission to ‚Äúfoster, promote, and facilitate‚Äù data science through consulting, education, and training. Housed in the beautiful <a href=\"https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/library/\">Shields Library</a>, the DSI supports students in learning new skills and researchers involved in data-driven projects. We met with members of DSI to discuss the Dat in the Lab project at UC Davis. DSI members raised valuable questions around Dat‚Äôs current conflict management model.</p>\n<p>How does Dat manage conflicts now? In the current version of Dat, one person creates and shares a Dat. This ‚Äúone writer‚Äù has write-access to the files. Others can download (<code>dat clone</code>) the files and keep up to date with changes (<code>dat sync</code>).  However, these other writers can not push their changes back to the original file. Essentially, Dat is so conflict averse that we do not even allow conflicts to happen. Why this design? Our early use cases were published datasets. ‚ÄúOne writer‚Äù is effective at getting people access to datasets, or parts of datasets, that are updated by a main data source via cloning and syncing. However, our conversations at UC Davis highlighted an additional set of researcher needs. In order to work with researchers engaged in data generation and analysis, we need to address collaboration.</p>\n<p>To move upstream from publishing in the research process, Dat will need to be optimized for collaboration.  ‚ÄúOne writer‚Äù design means that one computer controls changes to the dataset. Dat needs to enable ‚Äúmulti-writer‚Äù collaboration in order to bring researchers into Dat-based workflows early in their projects. Lucky for us, our team-member Mathias Buus, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mafintosh\">mafintosh</a> as he is known to the world, is working on a ‚Äúmulti-writer‚Äù feature that will allow one writer to invite multiple collaborators. That feature is now prioritized for deployment!</p>\n<p>After meeting with DSI, we delivered our shiny new hands-on workshop (complete with all the bugs of the first instance of a hands-on workshop).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/0000405-DSC01576-resize.jpg\" alt=\"0000405-DSC01576-resize\"></p>\n<p>We met people in the CWS and beyond and learned about fish genomics, <a href=\"http://groundwaternitrate.ucdavis.edu/\">groundwater nitrates</a>, the <a href=\"https://pisces.ucdavis.edu/\">PISCES</a>, and more. Thank you for being patient with the bugs at the workshop, UC Davis! We also uncovered some unique issues with UC campus wifi, which blocked local peer-to-peer laptop communication. So we had the opportunity to develop some workarounds for that. Nevertheless, workshop participants were able to use Dat command line tools to share, sync, and publish to the web. We learned from the workshop attendees and are looking forward to reconnecting to hear about their ideas for Dat in workflows.

Feel free to watch the video or scroll down to read the notes.</em></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bE1LAxYazbY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>In the 18th, 19th centuries it was thought that property ownership was the only way to protect common resources such as grazing pastures. Garrrett Hardin famously put it: &quot;The individual benefits as an individual from his ability to deny the truth even though society as a whole, of which he is a part, suffers.&quot;</p>\n<p>It was thought that communities that only act in rational self interest destroy the common pool resource they are sharing. This is described as &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot;: that isolated, autonomous individuals will always choose the path best for them as individuals.</p>\n<p>Elinor Ostrom introduced a new body of research to challenge this. Over 40 years of research, she was able to prove that Hardin exaggerated the problems involved in managing a commons. In 2009, Elinor Ostrom was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in economics. She talked about how people actually <em>are</em> able to come to together to form norms and rules that sustain their mutual cooperation. For example, she went to Nepal and studied how people there were managing their own irrigation systems. She found that if communities simply follow eight principles, a sort of blueprint, communities use to self-govern and sustain the resource without depleting it.</p>\n<p>What about applying this to the internet? Before her death in 2012 Ostrom published a book with Charlotee Hess called <em>Understanding Knowledge as a Commons</em>. This book laid the groundwork for thinking of digital knowledge as a commons (that is the digital artifacts in libraries, wikis, open source code, scientific articles, and everything in between).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-internet-as-a-commons\">The Internet as a Commons <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-internet-as-a-commons\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Looking at the internet as a commons ‚Äî as a shared resource ‚Äî allows us to understand both its unlimited possibilities and also what threatens it.</p>\n<p>What threatens the internet? Right now, private companies that control large parts of the internet are trying to prevent the internet of commons. If products fail or are deemed not economically viable (for example Vine, Google Reader, etc), the whole suffers. Monopolies, like Google, are able to keep their power by influencing the political landscape. However, in the internet of commons, monopolies are no longer in control, and users would be trusted to self-govern the commons.</p>\n<p>Decentralization has been the most recent proposal as our technological means to get away from this and give the power to users. In a decentralized world, users get to control the contracts of the website, can choose to fork that website, re-host data to fix broken links, evade censorship, and overall take ownership of their data. Freedom of expression, privacy, and universal access to all knowledge should be inherent to the web. But right now, those values are not.</p>\n<h3 id=\"locking-the-web-open\">Locking the Web Open <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#locking-the-web-open\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Thinking of the internet as a commons allows us to think of different ways we can moderate and grow spaces, allow innovation to flourish, and improve the quality of knowledge and information sharing. As Brewster Kahle puts it, decentralization ‚ÄòLocks the Web Open.‚Äô</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not just dreaming of a new world with Brewster Kahle about the future of the internet. The internet of commons is here today. Peer-to-peer (p2p) applications already exist, are being built, as well as used by real users as we speak ‚Äî you can build one too! <a href=\"http://scuttlebot.io/\">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, for example, is a completely p2p protocol for syncing data. <a href=\"https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork\">Patchwork</a> is a social networking application built on top of the Secure Scuttlebutt Protocol. People can join a public server and make friends, then use a gossip approach to find friends of friends. Many early adopters come from IRC and have started using it instead of IRC. It‚Äôs immensely successful as a little protocol and you can build something with it today.</p>\n<p>Dat is inspired by BitTorrent and built in a similar fashion to Scuttlebutt. It is a decentralized protocol for storing, versioning, and syncing streams of potentially very large datasets. We‚Äôre a non-profit, funded by grants and, so far, we've operated more like a research lab than a company.</p>\n<p>A foundational part of what we‚Äôve been doing for the past three years is to work with university labs, libraries, researchers, and universities to help them manage their scientific data. Scientific articles and their related data are very specific and yet good use case for a commons approach to the internet.</p>\n<p>As companies privatize data they create silos or they put up paywalls, and prevent the growth of the commons ‚Äî another kind of enclosure. This means that certain people with power close the pathways into the commons so that they can profit from it... but it actually detracts from everyone‚Äôs ability to use it and also prevents its ability to flourish. Innovation suffers, as fewer people have access to the knowledge and it is much harder to produce contributions that could improve that research. The rationale given for companies to create paywalls is that it is expensive to collect, store, organize, present, and provide bandwidth for the billions of pages of articles and datasets.</p>\n<p>Decentralization is a clear way we can reduce the costs of this hosting and bandwidth ‚Äî as more people come to download the articles and data from the journal or library or university, the faster it gets. The dream is that universities could turn their currently siloed servers into a common resource that is shared amongst many universities. This would cut costs for everyone, improve download speed, and reduce the likelihood that data is lost.</p>\n<p>Decentralization of data produces challenges though ‚Äî just like a torrent, data that is decentralized can go offline if there aren‚Äôt any stable and trusted peers. In the case of scientific data, this is an immense failure. To mitigate it, we invoke the human part of a commons ‚Äî the data will be commonly managed. For example, we can detect how many copies are available in different places, just like a BitTorrent, and compute health for a dat ‚Äî for example, a dat hosted at the Internet Archive, University of Pennsylvania, and UC Berkeley is probably very healthy and has low probability of ever going offline, while a dat hosted by 5 laptops might go down tomorrow ‚Äî even though there are more peers. When a dat becomes less healthy, the community can be alerted and make sure the resource does not go down. Decentralized tech and decentralized humans working together to use commons methodology in practice.</p>\n<p>Along with this, what we get by design is that links can last forever, no matter what server they are hosted on ‚Äî using a decentralized network based on cryptographic links and integrity checks allow many servers to host the same content without security risks, a property not present in http.</p>\n<p>This concept of decentralization isn‚Äôt new. The internet was built upon the concept of it being very resilient, that if a node failed, it‚Äôd find another way to get information to other computers. The internet was originally decentralized, but over time it became clear that centralized parties were needed to fund and maintain websites on the internet. The move towards decentralization is almost a yearning for the past, a way to get around this really centralized section of internet history.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-the-future\">Building the Future <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#building-the-future\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A way we‚Äôve been thinking about building protocols for decentralization is looking to how current popular protocols were developed and mirroring those methods. Current very popular modes for transfer were developed by people like Tim Berners-Lee (CERN, www) and Vint Cerf (DARPA TCP/IP) who worked in research labs. They gave away their protocols for free to the public, as products of scientific inquiry. The secret sauce of what they did was to craft open standards that don‚Äôt need permission to use and reuse, prioritized usability, and involved no or low barriers to access. Even Google was founded from two folks in a university lab, who published their search algorithm PageRank.</p>\n<p>Today, I look at the decentralized landscape in context of what these people were doing back in the day and wonder if we‚Äôre continuing their legacy. Ideally, new decentralized protocols could be built into browsers that people already use today. Alongside <code>http://</code>, we imagine <code>dat://</code> view websites or data from a distributed network (which you can now do with the <a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com/\">Beaker Browser</a>!).</p>\n<p>I look at initial coin offerings (ICOs) and new blockchain companies that claim to be revolutionizing the way we work on the internet, and I‚Äôm not seeing this same model. I‚Äôm seeing white papers that are published, and sometimes even implemented in open source. But if you look at what they propose, many offer siloed networks that are privatized, with money being invested into specialized coins that create new enclosures. A big component of these ICOs are trust-less networks, which remove the human elements of trust and social groups from the network.</p>\n<p>Decentralization then, is not just a technological problem, it is also a human one. Researchers at MIT have been <a href=\"http://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb\">looking into</a> many of these decentralized tools and are <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/\">reaching similar conclusions</a> ‚Äî the technical problems are hard but we must solve the social and people problems if we want to progress: &quot;Decentralized web advocates have good intentions, but there is no silver-bullet technical solution for the challenges that lie ahead.&quot;</p>\n<p>To top it off, over $1.6 billion was invested in these ICOs in the past year alone. Where are we going? Is the future of decentralization going to be rooted in paywalls and coins, with the management of those coins and that technology trusted to a single individual or group? Is that really where we want to end up?</p>\n<p>With a commons approach to the decentralized web, the most ideal approach is guided from where we came. I am much more excited about creating protocols that are easy to use, develop with, and extend without asking for permission and without paying or having much money at all. That means that they are driven by the community, built for the public good, and given away for free. If the company or organization dies, the protocols should still be usable. Any blockchains involved should not be tied to a particular for-profit company. I should not be tying my data to any one coin or blockchain for fear of enclosure. The protocols should be optimizing for <strong>science</strong> (broadly speaking, as in developing knowledge) and mutual collaboration rather than optimizing for <strong>profit</strong>. Let us not recreate the problem we are trying to solve.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Over the summer, the Dat project turned four years old. In that time we've moved from a one-person prototype (see the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat/tree/464679267049899eafa345125a0f2212f91be456\">first readme</a>) to a nonprofit-run project. The Dat Project has always been open and public and we now need to become sustainable. We will carry forward with the same scrappy, open approach in our new chapter as a nonprofit company.</p>\n<p>In open source software development you see the best features alongside the bugs and errors. Similarly, we want to show you how we operate and develop as a business, mistakes and all. Today, we'll take a look back at our funding history. This post also comes with one of our first business learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>As a small project, depending entirely on a single source of revenue can be dangerous. Our experience over the summer highlighted that risk. In a for-profit startup, they say fund raising is a full-time job. Turns out that is just as true (if not more so) for non-profits. This summer, we learned the value of dedicated fundraising staff as we endured a gap in our funding. So the world zigged, and we zagged: we did part time contract work, consulting, and taught night classes while we hacked on Dat with the rest of our time. I'm excited to say we've got another huge technology update almost out the door: multi-author Dats.</p>\n<p>This post is a first in a series on moving the Dat project forward to becoming a sustainable nonprofit. In this series, we will look at common revenue models, challenges in funding general operating costs, and the future of public tech infrastructure. But before we look forward, we must look at the past.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we've received a <a href=\"/dat-in-the-lab/\">new grant from the Moore foundation</a> to partially support our work. This new grant will be a great opportunity for us to work closely with leading research labs in the University of California system. We continue to work with our network on additional funding sources, both long- and short-term, as we move towards sustainability. You can also <a href=\"https://donate.datproject.org/\">donate to support our work</a> now, and it's tax deductible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-funding-history\">Dat Funding History <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-funding-history\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Few open source startups are funded exclusively through grants. We want to use our unique position to help others find ways to support their work. Nadia Eghbal has <a href=\"https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/\">done</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand\">great work</a> on researching funding options for open source. She <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nayafia/how-i-stumbled-upon-the-internet-s-biggest-blind-spot-b9aa23618c58\">identified infrastructure and public data</a> as two of the major categories that struggle with funding ‚Äî and we fit into both!</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we will begin to open our books and grant history (of course, part of this is legally required as a nonprofit). In this post we will look at the financial side of things. In the future, we'll also work to publish a history of the grant applications and related work (<a href=\"http://libraries.io\">libraries.io</a> is a <a href=\"https://github.com/librariesio/supporters\">great example</a> of what we'll hope to do).</p>\n<h3 id=\"dat-expenses\">Dat Expenses <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-expenses\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The expenditures side of our budget is pretty straightforward, but slightly less transparent. Almost all of our grant revenue has gone towards developer salaries or travel (with a small percentage to our accountant). For most of our grants, we've all gotten paid the same salaries of $96,000 per year (as contractors, without benefits and pre-tax). Thanks to generous offers we do not pay for hosting or many services we use; nor do we have offices or other traditional business expenses. We will start to put processes in place to make our salaries and expenses more transparent in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dat-revenue\">Dat Revenue <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-revenue\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Dat Project has received <strong>five grants</strong> totaling <strong>$1.48 million</strong> over our four year history. Until very recently, grants have been our sole source of revenue. We've now started to accept donations (we are <a href=\"https://github.com/joehand/stripe-dat\">working on storing anonymous donation data</a> on Dat so we can make more nice graphs!). We also received $15k to pay for our incorporation and nonprofit application (not shown below).</p>\n<p>Taking rough averages of our grants over time, you can see our monthly revenue for the past four years and looking towards the upcoming year. Notice the few funding gaps we've gone through, including the most recent dip:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/09/chart--1-.png\" alt=\"Funding history\"></p>\n<p>In the graph, you can see each of the five grants we've received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>June 2013, $50k - <a href=\"https://knightfoundation.org/grants/6001\">Knight Foundation, Prototype Fund</a> (7 months)</li>\n<li>April 2014, $260k - <a href=\"https://usopendata.org/2014/04/02/dat/\">Sloan Foundation, General Support</a> (1 year)</li>\n<li>April 2015, $640k - <a href=\"https://usopendata.org/2015/04/03/sloan/\">Sloan Foundation, General Support</a> (2 years)</li>\n<li>April 2016, $420k - <a href=\"/announcing-publicbits-org/\">Knight Foundation, news challenge</a> (1 year)</li>\n<li>Sept. 2017, $110k - <a href=\"\">Moore Foundation, Dat in the Lab</a> (1 year, $180k total)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The initial grant was focused on the civic data use case, after Max Ogden's experience with <a href=\"https://www.codeforamerica.org/\">Code for America</a>. With the Sloan foundation, Dat shifted our focus to scientific use cases. We've continued to have our eye on both types of users as we have made Dat a more general purpose file protocol with other applications in libraries, software development, and the decentralized web.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, we will continue to pursue grants for a portion of our projects but are looking to diversify sources of support in order to become sustainable. We are exploring ways we can fund the rest of the team in the next few posts in this series. Keep an eye out, you can also <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dat_project\">follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>\n",

In this post series, we will highlight new Dat-related work and interesting things from our community. There are a few other pieces we've had our head down working on that we're looking forward to showing soon!</p>\n<p>Recently, we've shipped these things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selective Sync in CLI &amp; a <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat/releases/tag/v13.8.0\">new releaase</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat-http\">Dat HTTP Storage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/node-on-mobile/node-on-android\">Node on android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://chat.datproject.org\">Dat Chat</a> via hyperirc</li>\n<li>Updated blog &amp; style</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"selective-sync\">Selective Sync <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#selective-sync\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Dat's design means each user only downloads the data they request but it was not possible to do this in the CLI, until now. This powerful feature allows users to download only the files they want, even from a massive Dat.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat/releases/tag/v13.8.0\">Dat CLI release</a> adds selective sync along with key backup and importing. Selective sync allows you to specify which files you want to download either with an argument or using the <code>.datdownload</code> file. <code>dat sync</code> will download and keep updated on the selected files. This means you can put large datasets into Dat but have control over what files you download where.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dat-http-storage\">Dat HTTP Storage <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-http-storage\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We are very excited about leverging Dat's agnostic storage capabilities. This means you can store your files where ever and retrieve them with whatever protocol you want.*</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat-http\">Dat HTTP Storage</a>, files can be stored on regular http servers and downloaded via Dat. We're only starting to consider the feature possibilities of this, but it means we can start hosting Dats on any static file server, such as S3.

      "title": "Locking Science Open with Decentralized Scientific Archives",
      "content_html": "<p>Last year, we spoke at Internet Archive's <a href=\"https://www.decentralizedweb.net/\">Decentralized Web Summit</a> and demonstrated Dat as a way to lock open scientific articles, data, and code together in one decentralized archive.  The Internet Archive has been publicly calling for decentralized and distributed technology as a way to improve the health of the overall Internet, by <a href=\"http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/\">locking data open</a>.</p>\n<p>But what do we mean by 'locking data open' in the context of scientific archives?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;While different websites are located all over<br>\nthe world, in most cases, any particular website has only one physical location. Therefore, if the hardware in that particular location is down then no one can see that website. In this way, the Web is centralized: if someone controls the hardware of a website or the communication line to a website, then they control all the uses of that website.&quot; - <em>Brewster Kahle</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Standard practice now for scientific archives is to use HTTP links to datasets stored on centralized servers, which can cause dead links  -- <a href=\"/mention-in-the-new-york-times/\">one that librarians and thousands of volunteers are desperate to solve</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-proposal\">The proposal <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-proposal\">#</a></h4>\n<p>What we're offering with decentralized infrastructure is a slightly more complicated approach to storing and distributing data, with great benefits. This approach <strong>does not</strong> remove DOI or DNS or HTTP -- it's simply a way to reference data in a unified way so that it can be downloaded from many servers at once. In a decentralized architecture, anyone has the ability to download and re-host data without changing it's permanent identifier.</p>\n<p>The scholarly archiving infrastructure can be upgraded to incorporate more decentralized components without changing the 'UX' for the researcher. The archives can mask the links to raw data the same way they do today by using friendly naming systems like DNS or DOI. In Dat's case, which is different than IPFS, a public key is your address, not the hash -- which means that data can even be updated over time with history intact, without losing future-proof benefits.</p>\n<p>For us, peer-to-peer is about user control, resiliency, and distribution efficiency. A peer-to-peer system would scale with the amount of data and link rot we see in the future, while the current infrastructure is already beginning to crumble in the face of a serious reproducibility crisis.</p>\n<h4 id=\"on-'future-proofing'-and-hash-collisions\">On 'future-proofing' and hash collisions <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#on-'future-proofing'-and-hash-collisions\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Max Ogden pointed me to David Rosenthal's <a href=\"http://blog.dshr.org/2017/05/blockchain-as-infrastructure-for-science.html\"><em>Blockchain as an Infrastructure for Science</em></a> which talks about how peer-to-peer tools like Dat and IPFS would not work for scientific archives. David said that decentralized infrastructure that uses cryptographic hashes would not work as a future-proof method because &quot;<em>Hashes are not persistent over the timescales needed because, as technology improves over time, it becomes possible to create 'hash collisions', as we have seen recently with SHA1.</em>&quot;</p>\n<p>The hash collision problem that David brings up is a huge stretch, and not applicable to the popular decentralized web technologies such as Dat.</p>\n<p>We asked <a href=\"https://github.com/blahah\">Richard Smith-Unna</a>, a researcher and former Mozilla Science fellow about this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Right now, there is one known full SHA1 collision and exploiting it to attack the BitTorrent protocol requires poisoning the original data and the spoof data with the two known clashing files. It was a huge effort to generate the collision. The stronger hashing algorithms present in most modern applications pushes this problem so far into the future that the entire cryptographic infrastructure of the world would be at risk before it caused a problem for scientific archives. If hash collision attacks were to be on the horizon, you release a new version of the protocol that prefers the stronger hash. Announce it and stable nodes upgrade, over time corresponding to the adoption of the upgrade the stronger hash dominates until it completely replaces the old one. This is already happening with bittorrent moving to sha256. - <em>Richard Smith-Unna</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We're very confident in the impressive theoretical and practical work of hundreds of cryptographers that are endorsing the use of SHA256 and elliptic curve cryptography. There are reasons why an organization may not want to use a decentralized data infrastructure -- but hash collisions are not one of them.</p>\n<h5 id=\"sustaining-the-archive\">Sustaining the Archive <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#sustaining-the-archive\">#</a></h5>\n<p>Currently, large institutions that run scientific archives sustain themselves by charging libraries and researchers to access data. The theory goes that this centralized control of data therefore helps their business model, and giving away scientific archives for free would destroy the market, and thus the archives themselves.</p>\n<p>In actuality, these large institutions already commit to long-term funding of data storage and availability with no user-facing cost. With a decentralized architecture, it would be the same -- but the load on those systems would be lower. The burden is on libraries and scientific publishers to keep at least one server available with the data, like they currently do -- but everyone benefits from lower bandwidth cost as more data is decentralized.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what's-next\">What's next <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what's-next\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Since then, we've been working hard to build partnerships with libraries and universities to use Dat to store these scientific bundles and lock them open forever. We're excited about decentralizing more data beyond our current work with <a href=\"https://www.datarefuge.org/\">Data Refuge</a> to partner with research labs, universities, and libraries to reduce their costs while advancing openness. It seems like whether large institutions like it or not, decentralized data tools like Dat are starting to be a viable distribution mechanism amongst the most advanced scientists today.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>A few weeks ago, after being charmed by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CSVConference/status/859876757448433664\">comma llama</a> (an alpaca), the Dat team put our final touches on the <strong>Dat protocol</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/docs/blob/master/papers/dat-paper.pdf\">white paper</a>. Today, we are releasing Dat Desktop, dat command line, and <a href=\"http://datproject.org\">datproject.org</a> with full protocol support! We are seriously excited for this release and believe it is a big step forward in sharing our vision for Dat and the future of public data.</p>\n<p>See the release notes to learn more about the changes for each app, and see install details below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0\">Dat Desktop v2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/dat/releases/tag/v13.0.0\">dat command line v13</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/datproject.org/releases/tag/1.1.0\">datproject.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read on to learn more about why we upgraded and what makes the new Dat protocol special.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-new-dat-protocol\">The New Dat Protocol <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-new-dat-protocol\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Dat is a distributed data tool putting security and speed first. The open Dat protocol makes automatic version history, encrypted transfer, and dynamic data storage the default. Building on our protocol, we created a new kind of file syncing and data publishing software in Dat Desktop and dat command line.</p>\n<p>With the needs of researchers, librarians, and developers in mind, Dat's unique design works wherever you store your files. Dat virtually ties folders together across computers. This means you can share a folder on your computer, send your link, and other users can instantly have a live copy or view the files on <a href=\"http://datproject.org\">datproject.org</a>. By combining user-friendly applications with modern distributed infrastructure, scientists can more easily collaborate on data while improving privacy, reproducibility, and long-term preservation.</p>\n<p>Use Dat to publish research data, create resilient archives, or run continuous file backup. With <a href=\"https://docs.datproject.org/http\">Dat's new HTTP support</a>, you can sync folders live from your computer to the web. Dat gives your existing filesystem magical powers.</p>\n<img src=\"/content/images/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-26-at-19.46.58.png\" alt=\"Dat\" style=\"width:75%;\"/>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>Share folders from your computer to anyone in seconds with your dat link. Dat transfers data directly between computers for fast and secure sharing.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Dat protocol and Dat's open source libraries empower developers to create novel yet powerful tools using public and decentralized data. Applications, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair#readme\">Science Fair</a> and the <a href=\"http://beakerbrowser.com\">Beaker Browser</a>, can leverage Dat for painless data management and secure peer-to-peer browsing. Dat's Javascript reference implementation allows for greater portability. If you were familiar with Dat before, we are happy to tell you the new protocol improved speeds up to 100x!</p>\n<p>Dat project is led by <a href=\"http://codeforscience.org\">Code for Science &amp; Society</a>, a U.S. nonprofit, with a global open source community.

Dat uses a cryptographically secure register of changes to prove that the requested data version is distributed. A byte range of any file's version can be efficiently streamed from a Dat repository over a network connection. Consumers can choose to fully or partially replicate the contents of a remote Dat repository, and can also subscribe to live changes. To ensure writer and reader privacy, Dat uses public key cryptography to encrypt network traffic. A group of Dat clients can connect to each other to form a public or private decentralized network to exchange data between each other. A reference implementation is provided in JavaScript.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

      "content_html": "<h3 id=\"vendor-lock-in\">Vendor Lock-In <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#vendor-lock-in\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The Peer-to-peer Web is a way of thinking about distributing web content over the internet that doesn‚Äôt rely on a central point of failure. Failure sometimes means the service disappears (like the Dropbox Public folder this week). Another type of failure is failure to scale due to a bottleneck. A good example of this is data infrastructure like Amazon S3 and Google Drive. By storing all your data in one place they create a bandwidth bottleneck that they then make you pay for. For a primer on the P2P web principles I recommend the post <a href=\"http://pfrazee.github.io/blog/what-is-the-p2p-web\">What is the P2P Web?</a> To quote that article, &quot;Once integrated into a browser, these principles enable users to publish independently of services, and move between applications freely&quot;.</p>\n<p>To me the P2P web distinguishes itself from the web today by putting the user in control of their data. The web has long been about open standards for building cross platform applications like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but falls short of providing a standard way for a user to control their online presence and data, e.g. being able to export their account from one application to another or use services like GMail without letting Google read their emails. Instead the web we have today becomes more and more siloed as large advertising based companies like Facebook and Google are incentivized to get us to give them more and more of our data. They have no incentive to let users easily export their data to or cohabitate their account with other competing services, so such mechanisms for putting the user in control of where their data lives never get built.</p>\n<p>Users should be able choose where their data lives and who has access to it. Ultimately the P2P web is about giving users a choice based on their level of trust. On the web today the choice is binary, basically &quot;their way way or the highway&quot;. If you sign up for and use a service like Facebook, you are trusting Facebook as the steward of your data. Your only other choice is to never sign up. They don‚Äôt provide you with a way to happily sync your Facebook account with all its data in realtime into other competing services over an open protocol, so if Facebook decides one day that they are going to stop hosting your old Instagram photos (like Twitter is currently doing with Vine), it becomes a scramble for users to back up their data before it gets deleted forever.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-privacy-and-trust\">User Privacy and Trust <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#user-privacy-and-trust\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Today‚Äôs advertising based services have these incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1: Acquire more user data (for advertising)</li>\n<li>2: Keep users data and privacy protected, as long as it doesn‚Äôt hinder #1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having all our data stored in one physical location is obviously bad if the service disappears or is hacked into and leaked online or secretly subpoenaed by the government. For this post let‚Äôs set the issue of long term storage privacy aside and instead focus on on reader privacy.</p>\n<p>Reader privacy means protecting the privacy of what a user is looking at. For example, if you walk into a library and ask the librarian to help you find a certain book, most librarians are morally obligated to keep what book you asked for a secret. Similarly, therapists and lawyers also protect the privacy of conversations with their clients. If someone were to follow you, they could figure out that you‚Äôre visiting a library or a lawyers office, but they wouldn‚Äôt know what you are talking about.</p>\n<p>Reader privacy is possible online thanks to HTTPS. When you go to sites like <a href=\"http://facebook.com\">facebook.com</a> or <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org\">wikipedia.org</a>, people who hack into your traffic can see that you‚Äôre visiting those domains but that‚Äôs it. They can‚Äôt tell which Facebook profiles or Wikipedia pages you are reading, because the traffic between you and those sites is encrypted. For sites like <a href=\"http://Archive.org\">Archive.org</a>, which is an online digital library run by librarians, reader privacy is a deeply held value.</p>\n<p>Thanks to HTTPS most centralized services on the web can do a pretty good job at ensuring that adversaries like man-in-the-middle hackers or the NSA can‚Äôt easily perform mass surveillance and figure out what we‚Äôre all doing online (at least at the time we are browsing).</p>\n<p>The nice feature of the model where users trust a single centralized service with all their data is that it is very simple to understand from the users perspective. They only have to connect to and trust one entity online. As long as they don‚Äôt get phished, they just have to look for the green lock icon next to '<a href=\"http://facebook.com\">facebook.com</a>' and they can be sure their connection cannot be monitored by anyone other than <a href=\"http://facebook.com\">facebook.com</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decentralization-vs.-reader-privacy\">Decentralization vs. Reader Privacy <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#decentralization-vs.-reader-privacy\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In most P2P systems you trust not one centralized remote server but a set of remote &quot;peers&quot;. The idea being that any peer that speaks a compatible P2P protocol can be discovered and act as a server if they have information you want. It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôll search for and discover many peers when using a P2P service.</p>\n<p>BitTorrent clients for example search a single global network (the BitTorrent DHT) to find IP addresses of peers who claim to have data that the client is searching for. For this reason BitTorrent has <strong>very poor</strong> reader privacy, almost none at all. If you want to perform mass surveillance to find out what IP addresses are searching for and downloading torrents, you simple run a honeypot server on the DHT that advertises that it has every torrent from popular torrent tracker sites. Soon you will be inundated with requests for the data you claim to advertise, but you can simply log all the IPs you see and ignore their requests for data.</p>\n<p>In this way BitTorrent trades bandwidth for reader privacy, which is an inherent tradeoff in P2P systems. In order to create the largest swarms possible and use as much bandwidth as possible, BitTorrent does not include a mechanism for protecting the privacy of what a BitTorrent client is looking for. If we were to naively host public websites using BitTorrent it would be difficult to protect for example what Wikipedia pages are being read by a certain IP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"p2p-web-privacy-modes\">P2P Web Privacy Modes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#p2p-web-privacy-modes\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can break down privacy/trust tradeoffs on the P2P web into three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trust everyone - Bad reader privacy. Ask anyone in the world, trust that none of them will use the information in your query against you.</li>\n<li>Trust a single source - Good reader privacy. You only trust one entity online. How the web mostly works today, you trust whoever owns the SSL certificate.</li>\n<li>Web of Trust - You trust a set (e.g. whitelist) of entities to keep your query private. Could work in e.g. academic settings where you have services hosted by reputable public institutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the context of Dat, a file sharing tool that wants to support good reader privacy but also take advantage of bandwidth and redundancy gains from decentralization, the Web of Trust model is very interesting. For example we could have clients trust any verified academic data library (e.g. ones hosted at verified public Universities) to preserve reader privacy. That way Dat clients could still connect to many fast sources around the world and get fast and cheap bandwidth for their data transfers, without having to expose what they are searching for to any random unverified IP address like how BitTorrent works.</p>\n<p>In a Web of Trust model you are trusting a set of entities. One entity could still turn evil later and start logging or leaking your search queries, but this is part of the unavoidable tradeoff of trust vs. decentralization. Our goal with Dat is to provide a way to curate, distribute and revoke entities from secure &quot;Web of Trust&quot; manifests, so that if a bad actor needs to be removed it can be done so in a way that clients can automatically subscribe to a feed of revocations and additions. SSL certificates have a similar issue, which is being addressed by projects like Certificate Transparency.</p>\n<p>This will allow us to build a dataset registry that can help connect users wanting to privately search for datasets and the sources online that have those datasets. As long as you trust the registry, and the registry trusts all of the sources to maintain reader privacy, a client can use the registry as a sort of anonymous proxy to find trusted data mirrors and then privately and securely introduce them such that an outside mass surveiller wouldn‚Äôt be able to deduce what dataset is being searched for or downloaded.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#in-summary\">#</a></h3>\n<p>P2P systems can address issues around data silos and vendor lock in that prevent users from being in control of their data and putting user data at risk of large data hacks and leaks, but they can also be a double edged sword that sacrifices reader privacy if trust models around peer discovery are not carefully considered.</p>\n<p>Do you have another approach to reader privacy in P2P systems?

      "title": "Reflections from International Data Week 2016",
      "content_html": "<p>International Data Week in September 2016 brought together three events, SciDataCon, the International Data Forum, and the Research Data Alliance 8th plenary. Joe Hand from the Dat team attended the conference.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://internationaldataweek.org\">International Data Week</a> featured sessions on the wide topic of using data in science. I attended on sessions focused on scientific data publishing, an emerging and urgently needed field. Dat entered this field alongside established organizations such as publishers, research institutions, and non-profits. Data publishing enables citation of data and improves reproducibility. The conference showcased a huge range of approaches to this problem.</p>\n<p>Data citation models parallel current academic publishing and reputation models. In academia, grants, funding, and career advancement all depend on citations. Standardized metadata improves the ability to cite data. It also enables journal publishers to connect datasets to papers in their journals.</p>\n<p>Reproducibility overlaps with, but does not require data citation. Researchers can reproduce papers without data citations or even without public data. Current reproducibility efforts favor short term reproducibility by using existing web infrastructure. This sacrifices long term preservation by using infrastructure not built for archiving.</p>\n<p>In the long tail of research data, data types are more unique and fewer people use each dataset. Few centralized data publishing services appeal to this long tail of researchers. Citation and reproducibility become more difficult in the long tail without new infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Data publishing organizations use existing web infrastructure to create data citation and reproducibility services. This infrastructure does not support data publishing needs by default. Building data publishing services on top of the web may threaten long term sustainability. Data sharing, discovery, and preservation are the primary design ideas behind the Dat infrastructure. By embedding these needs into infrastructure, data publishers can provide services without endangering data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"metadata-standards-and-data-publishing\">Metadata Standards and Data Publishing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#metadata-standards-and-data-publishing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The treatment of publishing of academic papers is informing the discussion around data publishing. Researchers livelihoods often rely on proper citation for their work. Citations allow them to get more grants and secure tenure. Some data publishing organizations are creating data publishing structures that mirror those of journals. To support this idea, there was a large focus on standard metadata and a common data citation process.</p>\n<p>Data publishing systems showcased throughout the week had similar goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A researcher should be able to publish their data.</li>\n<li>Another research should be able to find, download, and use the data.</li>\n<li>Any published work should cite the data used, crediting the researcher that originally published the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As data publishing exists today, there are no standard ways to cite data. Unlike papers, data may change before other researchers use it. Citing data requires the ability to cite versions of data, subsets of data, or forks of data. Organizations are trying to solve the citation problem in parallel. This is leading to the standards problem:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png\" alt=\"xkcd standards\"><br>\n<em>Source: <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">xkcd 927</a></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"reproducibility-and-long-term-preservation\">Reproducibility and Long Term Preservation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#reproducibility-and-long-term-preservation\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Reproducibility was another major theme of the week. When researchers publish papers, other researchers should be able to independently verify the results. Reproducing results is currently impossible for many papers involving data or software. Researchers do not always publish data or software to their papers. If they do publish data, they may not publish it in a manner that other researchers can re-run analysis.</p>\n<p>With the explosion in data repositories, science may be making headway as more researchers publish data. The <a href=\"http://re3data.org\">re3data registry</a> has over 1,500 data repositories registered. Unfortunately, repositories have their own metadata formats, publishing processes, and varying underlying software.</p>\n<p>Dissimilarity in data publishing has major implications for long term reproducibility. In the fast-moving era of the web, we see online services start up and shut down daily. Websites that were there one day are gone the next. Data powering these sites can disappear as users lose countless hours they have contributed.</p>\n<p>We may lose of troves of data if organizations build repositories with a similar approach to web services. This could have with potentially disastrous results for reproducibility and science in general. Rising research costs and aging web infrastructure point to a stark future for published data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-cascading-costs-of-data-publishing\">The Cascading Costs of Data Publishing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-cascading-costs-of-data-publishing\">#</a></h3>\n<p>As academic institutions face rising costs, we could lose the progress in data publishing. Libraries are already pushing back against rising journal prices. During the week, librarians expressed concern over paying the costs of data repositories. Each data repository has their own funding and revenue model. Yet, many rely on libraries or researchers to pay at some point, either to get data or to publish data.</p>\n<p>Many research institutions already have servers to backup and archive data for researchers. Few repositories make it possible for institutions to leverage their existing infrastructure. Universities may have to pay twice to backup the same data. Data will exist on their institutional servers and on a common data repository platform. Because of reliance on web infrastructure, data published in many places will be invisible to each other. If a platform shuts down, external researchers may not be able to access the data even if it is archived on a university's server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-long-tail-of-data-and-the-reproducibility-crisis\">The Long Tail of Data and the Reproducibility Crisis <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-long-tail-of-data-and-the-reproducibility-crisis\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The long tail of research data exacerbates the citation and reproducibility problems. Online distribution makes it much easier for users to share and discover long tails. For example, Amazon made the long tail of books available ‚Äì each book interests only a few people but there are many of them. Demand for items in long tail exceeds the demand for the most popular items. There is a parallel long tail in research data.</p>\n<p>Like rare books on Amazon, there is a long tail of research data. These datasets only have a few downloads but in total they have more demand than popular datasets. More importantly, there is a long tail of researchers needing to publish data. Their data does not fit within existing metadata, standards, or data repositories. To ensure reproducibility, we need to have a place for these researchers to publish their data without significant overhead.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, publishing long tail data can be a challenge. Researchers have to decide on which, if any, general access repository fits their needs. Often these repositories have restrictions on sizes or types of data. Additionally, they encourage publishing completed data, making the process an afterthought instead of a central part of the workflow. Researchers will publish their data only if they have a strong incentive or requirement to.</p>\n<p>We have to understand how long tail data will fit if we want to succeed in ensuring reproducibility and common data citation. Otherwise, we will lose the majority of data that does not fit in existing platforms. The difficulty of using the tools must not outweigh the benefit researchers receive for publishing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-publishing-services-on-data-first-infrastructure\">Building Publishing Services on Data-First Infrastructure <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#building-publishing-services-on-data-first-infrastructure\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Creating a common data sharing infrastructure is essential, as the long-tail issues make clear. Existing general-purpose data publishing services exist. But they do not integrate into scientific workflow and have other constraints from using web technologies. Organizations need to focus on wide adoption and long term data archiving, regardless of the metadata. It will not matter what data citation standards exist if the data is lost.</p>\n<p>Dat integrates directly into the workflow of any researchers that use file-based data. Data remains on their local computers instead of creating unlinked or duplicate copies on cloud services. Dat enables efficient and long-term storage of data by using decentralized infrastructure. This means that data does not need to exist in one location. Instead, institutions collaborate on data preservation, reducing potential points of failure. Researchers can download data from anywhere without needing to know who archived the data.</p>\n<p>Accurate and future-proof citation requires identifiers for specific versions or subsets of data. If data changes over time, other researchers should be able to the history enabling full reproducibility. Infrastructure allowing scientists to collaborate on data while retaining citation and history is essential.</p>\n<p>Dat provides live and persistent identifiers. Researchers can update data without changing the know identifier. This allows continuous archiving of data while research is occurring, not only after publishing. Append-only logs, common in blockchain technologies, allow data citations that point to specific versions of data. Change history is automatically tracked allowing complete reproducibility throughout the data analysis process.</p>\n<p>Building data publishing services on existing infrastructure has a low upfront cost. But using these dated technologies may have a high cost to reproducibility. Improving the underlying technologies will allow us to make data a primary citizen. If we do not publish data on data-first infrastructure then data citation, reproducibility, and archiving of data will be issues that continue to plague science.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>This week in Reykjavik, Iceland I attended PIDapalooza, the first community conference dedicated to the topic of persisent identifiers (PIDs) for the scholarly web. As a relative newcomer to this community I wanted to share my experience diving in head first into this subject.</p>\n<p>I also had the chance to give a presentation on possible uses of <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/pidapalooza2016\">public key cryptography in PID systems</a>, an area that is very relevant to our work on the <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/docs/blob/master/papers/dat-paper.pdf\">Dat protocol</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-persistent-identifier%3F\">What is a persistent identifier? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what-is-a-persistent-identifier%3F\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier\">PID</a> is just an ID that is persisted somewhere. For example, say I decided that the ID <code>1337</code> should point to my domain name <a href=\"http://maxogden.com\">maxogden.com</a>. If I store this reference in an online PID archive that promises to never delete it, and promises to never give out ID <code>1337</code> to anyone else, then I can cite ID <code>1337</code> in an academic paper and trust that the librarians of the world will forever be able to resolve ID <code>1337</code> to my website.</p>\n<p>If my website goes offline (say I forget to renew my domain), a librarian could in theory replace the reference to '<a href=\"http://maxogden.com\">maxogden.com</a>' with a new URL that points at an archived version of my site, so that when someone clicks the <code>1337</code> reference in my paper the link will still work. Please note that this is a purely theoretical scenario, I don‚Äôt know how many PIDs actually address the 'link rot' problem by fixing broken links in this way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-different-types-of-pids%3F\">What are the different types of PIDs? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#what-are-the-different-types-of-pids%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>At PIDapalooza I learned about a few different PID implementations. Note this is not an exhaustive list!</p>\n<h3 id=\"digital-object-identifier-(doi)\">Digital Object Identifier (DOI) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#digital-object-identifier-(doi)\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier\">DOIs</a> are the most popular PIDs used in scholarly communications. For most researchers, DOI is the only PID they will use to cite things. A DOI looks like <code>10.1000/182</code> but is usually displayed in URL form like <code>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</code>. The <code>10.1000</code> is the organizational ID. Organizations wishing to issue DOIs pay an annual fee to issue DOIs to the DOI foundation and get assigned an organizational ID namespace number. When DOIs get resolved (see next section), they are the authority for resolving that namespace number. The <code>182</code> is the resource ID issued by the issuing organization. The idea is that issuing organizations should never issue the same resource ID twice. Numbers are preferred over words, as words tend to have cultural meaning that drifts over time whereas numbers are more librarian friendly.</p>\n<p>To be allowed to create a DOI you have to be an issuing organization, pay an annual membership fee, and also pay around $1 per DOI you create, similar to a domain name except they are a one time fee.</p>\n<p>The most popular registrar for DOIs for scholarly publication use cases is called <a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/\">CrossRef</a>. CrossRef sells a DOI registration API as well as other value-add services for publishers. <a href=\"https://www.datacite.org/\">DataCite</a> is a ~5 person non-profit in the EU that promotes the use of DOIs to cite research data, and maintains and promotes a dataset schema that organizations can use when citing datasets.</p>\n<p>Today the ~80 million DOIs and the resolution metadata that is stored in the Handle system for each one is stored in CrossRef and takes up about 40GB of space. In this way CrossRef centralizes the decentralized Handle DOI infrastructure to make it usable and exposes this data over various APIs but does not make the full DOI corpus easily downloadable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"handle-system\">Handle System <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#handle-system\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_System\">Handle System</a> is a set of protocols designed in 1995 by <a href=\"https://gcn.com/Articles/2009/05/18/GCN-Interview-with-Robert-Kahn.aspx?Page=2\">Bob Kahn of TCP/IP fame</a> that are designed to manage a distributed set of persistent identifiers (handles) over IP. The DOI system is built on top of the Handle System. All DOIs are resolved through the Handle protocols, and DOI issuing organizations run Handle servers. The <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sun-handle-system-04\">Handle specification</a> defines the identifier format that DOI is based on: <code>Handle Naming Authority &quot;/&quot; Handle Local Name</code>.</p>\n<p>Handle defines a custom binary protocol, used over TCP/UDP port 2641, making it incompatible with the World Wide Web as it doesn‚Äôt use HTTP or DNS for both legacy and security reasons. However, the DOI system almost exclusively uses the Handle System through an HTTP proxy server <a href=\"https://hdl.handle.net\">https://hdl.handle.net</a> that exposes the Handle protocol over a REST API. There is one implementation of Handle written in Java that everyone uses, but it is not on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Handle allows a distributed group of providers, each one in charge of a separate prefix (e.g. the first part of a DOI), to register a public key with the Global Handle Registry (GHR) which is an authoritative service that manages, assigns and resolves requests to all prefixes. It‚Äôs pretty much DNS, except designed in a time that the Web was not as dominant or flexible. It‚Äôs unclear to me why it is still necessary to use Handle today other than for legacy reasons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"orcid\">ORCID <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#orcid\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://orcid.org/\">ORCID</a>, funded by the same EU grant as DataCite and a spin-off of CrossRef, is a ~20 person non-profit that assigns DOIs to individuals and provides a searchable directory where you can access the profile for a researcher. They don‚Äôt use DOIs but have their own identifier scheme <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCID\">based on ISNI</a> that look like <code>http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"archival-resource-key-(ark)\">Archival Resource Key (ARK) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#archival-resource-key-(ark)\">#</a></h3>\n<p>John Kunze from California Digital Library designed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archival_Resource_Key\">ARK</a> as an alternative to DOIs that may be better suited for the needs of long term preservation and libraries, as opposed to DOI/Handle which arose out of the publishing/e-commerce industries.</p>\n<p>The ARK system is free to use, as compared to DOIs which cost money to issue. ARK has a central prefix registry, run by the California Digital Library, which issues namespace prefix numbers similar to DOI. Other than this registry of prefixes institutions can issue and persist ARK identifiers and metadata for free to their own liking. This <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/digital-curation/JtzVwVVCPvA\">means</a> &quot;You don‚Äôt have to pay anyone, you just have to read the spec, get the institutional buy in, and start doing it.&quot;.</p>\n<p>ARK URLs look like <code>http://bnf.fr/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k</code>, and are pretty similar to DOIs but not exactly the same.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decentralized-identifiers\">Decentralized Identifiers <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#decentralized-identifiers\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This was my own idea, but you could in theory use a ED25519 public key as an identifier, removing the need for a central trusted namespace. If you add a resolution system where responses are signed by the key holder, and perhaps back the system by the PKI to solve the 'forgot my password' problem, you could build an identifier service that provides nice security guarantees without a <a href=\"http://blog.crossref.org/2015/01/problems-with-dx-doi-org-on-january-20th-2015-what-we-know.html\">central point of failure</a>. In fact this is pretty similar to what we do in Dat (as Dat links are in fact ED25519 public keys and transmitted data is signed using this key).</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong> I found this recent work called Decentralized Identifiers when Googling after writing this post: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-spec-working-draft-03.md\">https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-spec-working-draft-03.md</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"link-rot\">Link Rot <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#link-rot\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The commonly cited reason for using DOIs is to prevent link rot and/or content-drift. However, it is unclear to me how to measure the 'rotten-ness' of the DOI corpus. Herbert Von de Somple <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hvdsomp/status/796716360395059201\">presented at PIDapalooza about research</a> that analyzed HTTP links in published literature between 2007-2012 and found that around 10% of published links to the web are broken.</p>\n<p>Based on my limited understanding of Handle metadata, a DOI is a one-to-many relationship that maps an identifier to some number of possible typed resources. In the case that the resource is a URL, there can be many matches. However I do not believe that the metadata includes any content fingerprint, e.g. a SHA2 hash of an Internet Archive .warc. So it is unclear to me how exactly the DOI system fixes link rot.</p>\n<p>Some of my unanswered questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do DOI resolvers decide when it is acceptable to modify the metadata associated with the DOI in order to 'fix' link rot?</li>\n<li>Do all resolvers follow the same policy?</li>\n<li>If a resolver were to act maliciously, could they start returning false results without detection?</li>\n<li>Is there any version control for metadata over time, to see how different resolvers behaved at a certain point?</li>\n<li>How many resolvers use the cryptographic signing functionality offered by the Handle system?</li>\n<li>Do any resolvers integrate web capturing and content fingerprints to prove the link they fixed is the same content that the original DOI pointed at?</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "title": "Key Elements of Distributing Data",
      "content_html": "<p>The data distribution toolkit has become a mixed bag of tools that require different skill sets and are applied for different purposes. Git, for example, is a tool that works effectively for governing data (if you learn how to use it), but it quickly becomes unwieldy for larger datasets. BitTorrent is a great solution for distributing large datasets across many machines, but torrent files are static, and can become a hassle to use with changing data. BitTorrent Sync, DropBox, and Google Drive attempt to solve this problem, but they are proprietary software that fall short when it comes to governing data amongst teams or for the public eye. Data portals like Socrata, CKAN, or are custom built employ HTTP/FTP plus a good metadata file (and a hearty group of helping hands) and continue to be the most used method for publishing open data.</p>\n<p>All of these tools mentioned above have some of the key elements for open data distribution, but none of them have them all ‚Äì and this is why, I argue, they all fall short. These key elements are: open, streaming, historical, content-addressable, signable, indexable, and decentralized. In this blog post I‚Äôm going to cover each of these key elements and talk about why they‚Äôre important as well as what they offer us when attempting to distribute data to the public. I will also introduce the newest version of our tool, Dat, which contains all of these elements.</p>\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-bordered\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>signable</th>\n<th>open</th>\n<th>historical</th>\n<th>content-addressable</th>\n<th>decentralized</th>\n<th>indexable</th>\n<th>streaming</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Socrata</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CKAN</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FTP</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HTTP</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DropBox/Drive</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BitTorrent Sync</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Git</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dat</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n<td>‚úî</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Open.</strong> An open data tool should be open source. This isn‚Äôt simply out of principle ‚Äì it also enables developers to tweak the tool for use within a potentially complicated distribution system. This property is key for extensibility and stability of any distribution toolchain by not requiring dependence upon outside proprietary and corporate software. Most importantly, developers can peer review, or audit, the tool for reliability and safety. <em>Benefits: developer-friendliness, extensibilty, long-term stability.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Historical.</strong> Data should be versioned with cryptographically secure hashes. We can then prove the data is exactly what we need when we reference a particular version in scripts or analysis results. We can also audit the history of the data, which could be key for understanding errors in the data transformation or distribution pipeline. <em>Benefits: auditing, governance, provenance.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized.</strong> Data that is decentralized enables each user to have a complete copy of the data and its history. Then, data be manipulated locally before being re-published, either as a fork or as an update to the original dataset. As data is downloaded, it is served, reducing bandwidth and increasing efficiency as more people download data. When the original server goes offline, the data could still be available through the peer network, increasing the likelihood that the open data will be around as long as possible. If decentralized and versioned, the tool must use data structures that guarantee the data can be trusted even across many computers. That means using a decentralized tree called a merkle directed acyclic graph, what we find in Git, Blockchains, and other popular decentralized applications.  <em>Benefits: bandwidth, uptime.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Content-addressable.</strong> Each file should be split into chunks that are stored in the filesystem under a content-addressable scheme, so that all identical chunks are only downloaded once. This increases speed when downloading datasets that often repeat chunks of data, or when downloading new versions of a dataset that only have slight changes. <em>Benefits: bandwidth, storage.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Signable.</strong> Also known as authentication, each repository should be able to have an ‚Äòowner‚Äô that can prevent global editing of the dataset. This allows us to guarantee the integrity of the dataset by only allowing trusted users to edit and add data. <em>Benefits: security, collaboration, governance.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Streaming.</strong> A client should be able to retrieve data chunks immediately instead of being forced to download the entire contents of a dataset before reading. This also allows clients to listen to changes and update as soon as new data is published. <em>Benefits: live file syncing, live audio/video streaming, instantaneous upload/download.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Indexable.</strong> The tool will allow a client to download a particular byte range of a file. <em>Benefits: random access seeking, file indexing (e.g., rows in a csv).</em></p>\n<p>Our newest version of <a href=\"http://github.com/maxogden/dat\">dat</a> is a working implementation of these key elements. Check out the <a href=\"http://github.com/maxogden/dat\">GitHub repository now</a> to get started or see the <a href=\"http://dat.land\">online demo</a>. We are also always available in IRC, #dat on freenode, for questions, comments, or suggestions.</p>\n<p><strong>edit</strong>: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12020422\">See the discussion on hacker news</a></p>\n",

Knight Foundation</a> for a new project that we‚Äôre calling ‚ÄúPublicBits.‚Äù Our goal is to collect the world‚Äôs open data sources, to make their historical data available through a dataset registry at <a href=\"http://publicbits.org/\">PublicBits.org</a>. This ‚Äúdataset of datasets‚Äù will become accessible through a free, decentralized, redundant, open network, inspired by BitTorrent. <a href=\"http://PublicBits.org\">PublicBits.org</a> will use <a href=\"http://datproject.org/\">Dat</a>, our flagship project, to craft a new, collaborative framework that breaks down the silos of data portals. Our project takes inspiration from GitHub, the popular platform that allows developers to collaboratively develop software. We plan to bring the collaborative, historical, and reusable nature of open source to the open data movement.</p>\n<p>Developer Max Ogden started developing Dat with support from a <a href=\"http://knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/3/26/prototype-fund-winner-max-ogden-building-data-sharing-ecosystem/\">Knight Prototype Grant</a> in 2013. For the past two years, Dat has evolved with input from civic tech, journalism, and data science partners, and with $900,000 in funding from the <a href=\"http://www.sloan.org/\">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>. Through this process, we identified a significant pain point that spans the open data landscape, centered around the discovery and distribution of data. With PublicBits, we bring a new vision for an open data architecture that brings structure to the openness of data, by making it findable, manageable, and re-usable.</p>\n<p>Long ago, Max Ogden set out to build a ‚ÄúGitHub for data,‚Äù but through prototypes, we learned that a centralized model for data hosting is different than source code, posing problems for hosting big data. It‚Äôs possible to centrally host code as a service because code is small, but datasets are often too large to shuttle in and out of cloud storage, both because it can be computationally expensive process but also because it costs a lot of money. A distributed approach is more robust, cheaper, faster, and more open than a centralized model because it provides a strong network of redundant peers. To that end, we are pursuing partnerships with cloud storage companies, academic institutions, and internet freedom organizations to ensure there will be ‚Äúsuper-sharer‚Äù hosts available, with lots of reliable storage and bandwidth.</p>\n<p>The Dat development team will continue to be led by creator Max Ogden, while Dat teammember Karissa McKelvey will take the reins at PublicBits. It will be a challenge to find the right team and execute the plan within the allotted time for the grant. The design must also contend with a scale of data that could potentially be very large, diverse, and complicated. We need to make sure users will not get overwhelmed by the amount of data, and that we can return relevant results. These challenges will not be insurmountable without the right team. Thankfully, we are already experts in the field and have built simple prototypes of the PublicBits registry and desktop application.

You can try it out now (and remember to <a href=\"http://gitter.im/datproject/discussions\">let us know if things break</a>):</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g dat\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is our first 1.0 release candidate, meaning we will work on stability and performance until we feel comfortable enough to release a stable 1.0 for long-term support. <em>Please note that the alpha and beta versions of <code>dat</code> are not compatible with these new versions,</em> but this will be the last time that we choose to make backwards-incompatible changes.</p>\n<p>We also recently published a post about the previous versions of the <code>dat</code> CLI, and how the project has evolved, called <a href=\"http://datproject.org/blog/2016-01-19-brief-history-of-dat\">‚ÄúA Brief History of Dat.‚Äù</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"dat-overview\">Dat Overview <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-overview\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Dat is a command-line tool that we have been developing as an open source project with input from scientific research partners over the past two years. The pilot users have so far been in the fields of astronomy, bioinformatics, and neuroscience. These fields are becoming heavily data-based (e.g. digital imaging from telescopes and microscopes, DNA sequencing) and tend to share their research publicly on the web. We have been in a constant cycle of research and development during this period, and have rewritten the Dat CLI four times. Each rewrite incorporates the best modules and approaches from the last iteration and presents what we hope is a more straightforward workflow. We firmly believe this iterative process is the only way we could have arrived at the conclusions that led us to the features that we‚Äôre focusing on for the 1.0 release.</p>\n<p>Dat has been redesigned with the following goals in mind:</p>\n<h4 id=\"1.-ensure-datasets-can-be-accessed-even-if-the-original-data-source-becomes-unavailable\">1. Ensure datasets can be accessed even if the original data source becomes unavailable <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1.-ensure-datasets-can-be-accessed-even-if-the-original-data-source-becomes-unavailable\">#</a></h4>\n<p>The key principle is to let anyone who has data share it with anyone who wants that data, in an automated and decentralized way. This makes it possible to create many copies of data, so that if the original provider disappears, other providers can take their place. We are pursuing partnerships with cloud storage companies, academic institutions, and internet freedom organizations to ensure there will be ‚Äúsuper-sharer‚Äù nodes available, with lots of reliable storage and bandwidth. We will also be building an open-source registry service, funded by <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201551933/\">a generous grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2.-make-available-all-versions-of-all-datasets\">2. Make available all versions of all datasets <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2.-make-available-all-versions-of-all-datasets\">#</a></h4>\n<p>A drawback of existing peer-to-peer file sharing tools is that they lack the ability to dynamically update a dataset or access previous versions of a dataset. This is key for reproducibility of data, a huge issue in science. Every time a Dat repository is shared, Dat uses <a href=\"http://github.com/maxogden/rabin\">cryptographic fingerprinting</a> of the files to ensure others will get exactly the same data. Peers that wish to host previous versions of data may do so at the cost of more storage space.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3.-fast-dataset-transfer-speeds-at-reduced-cost\">3. Fast dataset transfer speeds at reduced cost <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#3.-fast-dataset-transfer-speeds-at-reduced-cost\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Downloads are frequently bandwidth-limited, either explicitly by the server or by the nature of clogged single-socket connections. We maximize transfer speeds by downloading in parallel from a swarm of nodes. Because we use Rabin fingerprinting (similar to rsync) Dat updates datasets by transferring only the data that changed. These two optimizations increase download bandwidth and reduces bandwidth costs, especially in cases where large datasets change only slightly between versions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"api\">API <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#api\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The new API is very simple. It comes with only two commands: one for sharing data, and one for downloading data.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sharing-data-with-dat-link\">Sharing data with <code>dat link</code> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#sharing-data-with-dat-link\">#</a></h4>\n<p><code>dat link</code> will create a unique hash for your data, and then serve it using our peer-to-peer network. This hash is generated from the contents of your files‚Äîif you change any files, the hash will change. In the future, we plan on creating feeds that will allow users to publish updates to old data, informing peers of newer versions, like Git.</p>\n<pre><code>$ dat link\nCreating share link for 19 files, 3 folders, 13.8 MB total\nLink: dat://a53d819bdf5c3496a2855df83daaac885686cac4b0bccfc580741b04898e3b32\nSharing data on port 3282, connected to 0/2 peers\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"downloading-data-with-dat\">Downloading data with <code>dat</code> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#downloading-data-with-dat\">#</a></h4>\n<p>To download the data shared by someone else, you can simply type <code>dat &lt;some-dat-link&gt;</code> and dat will traverse the peer to peer network, connect to anyone else that has a copy, and download the data directly from all of them simultaneously. File metadata and contents do not travel over any centralized servers‚Äîit flows directly from the peers to your computer. Peers are discovered using either <a href=\"http://npmjs.org/dns-discovery\">DNS</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bittorrent-dht\">BitTorrent DHT</a>, or WebRTC with the <a href=\"http://github.com/karissa/dat-desk\">desktop app</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>$ dat dat://a53d819bdf5c3496a2855df83daaac885686cac4b0bccfc580741b04898e3b32\nDownloaded 1/1 files (4 MB/s, 13.8 MB total)\nDownload complete, sharing data.

      "title": "A Brief History of Dat",
      "content_html": "<p>We have some exciting news to share about Dat: We‚Äôre working on a 1.0 release! It‚Äôs not out just yet, but you can try what we have so far by checking out <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat\">the <code>master</code> branch on GitHub</a> or with npm install dat@next -g</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd like to explain the history of the project and the design choices over the last 2 years since the project started, as the project has made some pretty substantial changes in direction during that time. We have been in a constant cycle of R&amp;D during this period, and have rewritten the Dat CLI four times.</p>\n<p>Each rewrite incorporates the best modules and approaches from the last iteration and presents what we hope is a more straightforward workflow. We firmly believe this iterative process is the only way we could have arrived at the conclusions that led us to the features we are currently focusing on for our 1.0 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"early-dat-prototype\">Early Dat Prototype <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#early-dat-prototype\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The original use case for Dat centered around tabular datasets that change often. We wanted to make something to simplify the process of updating your copy of the data when the publisher updates the source data. The prototype version of Dat was built over the course of 6 months and was completed in Spring of 2014.</p>\n<p>The prototype <code>dat</code> command-line tool only worked with tabular data and usage looked like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">dat init<br><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">'{\"hello\": \"world\"}'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> dat <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--json</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># put a JSON object into dat</span><br><span class=\"token function\">cat</span> some_csv.csv <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> dat <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--csv</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># stream a CSV into dat</span><br><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">$'a,b,c<span class=\"token entity\" title=\"\\n\">\\n</span>1,2,3'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> dat <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--csv</span> <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--primary</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span>a <span class=\"token comment\"># specify a primary key to use</span><br>dat <span class=\"token function\">cat</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># stream the most recent of all rows</span><br>dat push http://mydat.myserver.com:6461</code></pre>\n<p>In addition to <code>dat push</code> there was also <code>dat clone</code> and <code>dat pull</code>.</p>\n<p>An example of the canonical use case we had in mind at the time was an Excel spreadsheet that gets published on an FTP server. We envisioned Dat as a tool that could sit between the user and the Excel spreadsheet and add fast + efficient syncing of new updates as well as version control features, neither of which are supported by Excel files natively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dat-alpha\">Dat Alpha <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-alpha\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The Dat Alpha version was <a href=\"https://usopendata.org/2014/08/19/dat-alpha/\">released in August of 2014</a>. The major feature we worked on was support for syncing large, non-tabular data files. This opened up a new use case: using Dat as a sort of ‚ÄúDropBox for data‚Äù to sync a folder on your filesystem.</p>\n<p>The Alpha release was the first release after starting on a new grant that shifted our focus from open civic datasets (which tend to be tabular ‚Äì e.g. lots of database tables) to the field of data intensive scientific research, which tends to use domain specific flat-file based data formats.</p>\n<p>We worked directly, starting during the time of the Alpha and continuing on through to today, with some amazing research labs in fields like Astrophysics, Bioinformatics and Neuroscience to try and understand their data management problems. The addition of large file support in the Alpha was a direct result of getting feedback from these scientific pilot users.</p>\n<p>With the Alpha CLI we attempted to support both the tabular <em>and</em> file syncing use cases, which increased the API surface area quite a bit:</p>\n<pre><code>dat cat\ndat export\ndat import\ndat init\ndat help\ndat version\ndat pull\ndat push\ndat clean\ndat clone\ndat serve\ndat listen\ndat blobs get\ndat blobs put\ndat rows get\ndat rows delete\ndat rows put\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point in time we were very excited about the new file (AKA &quot;blobs&quot;) syncing use cases, but unsure about the intuitiveness of the API that we had come up with. User testing during this period revealed that when given a choice between two workflows, new users got very confused and it made getting started more difficult.</p>\n<p>To put your tabular data into version control you first have to know your schema, know your primary key (or come up with a composite primary key or use random unique IDs), and then build an import process that can be repeated when your source tabular data files change. This was a lot of work for users before they got to the gratifying parts like convenient push/pull/sync.</p>\n<p>Also because we presented separate &quot;row-oriented&quot; and &quot;blob-oriented&quot; workflows, users had to be able to understand the tradeoffs of both before making a choice, further complicating the onboarding process and path to a first gratifying experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dat-beta\">Dat Beta <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-beta\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The Beta version <a href=\"https://usopendata.org/2015/07/29/dat-beta/\">shipped in July of 2015</a>. The major focus was to make collaboration and reproducibility features possible by switching our internal data representation to a <a href=\"https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/20\">directed acyclic graph</a>. This means we can model fully decentralized workflows like pull requests on top of Dat, as well as offer versioning with cryptographic accuracy for entire datasets.</p>\n<p>Up until this version Dat acted more like a traditional centralized version control system (CVS) such as Subversion where there is a central repository and all clients must synchronize with the central database before they can send any change they made.</p>\n<p>The new DAG abstraction we developed during this time is called <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperlog\">hyperlog</a>. It provides a graph storage API that supports incremental, streaming replication. We used it in the <code>dat</code> CLI tool as the core database, and added tabular import and file import + synchronization features on top of it.</p>\n<p>In terms of command-line API, the beta didn‚Äôt change too dramatically from the alpha. We still supported both tabular and file oriented workflows. We dropped the word ‚Äúblob‚Äù in exchange for ‚Äúfiles‚Äù and used terms like ‚Äúread‚Äù and ‚Äúwrite‚Äù instead of ‚Äúget‚Äù and ‚Äúput‚Äù.</p>\n<p>The most notable new concept in the Beta was support for multiple datasets in a single repository. This was added to support datasets with hybrid data types, such as a astronomy full sky scan which might include raw image files from a telescope as well as tabular data created during post-processing of the images. You could model each one as a dataset in dat (sort of like two different sub-folders).</p>\n<pre><code>repository commands:\n  dat init        Create a new dat.\n  dat clone       Copy a dat to the local filesystem via http or ssh.\n  dat push        Push data to a remote dat.\n  dat pull        Pull data from a remote dat.\n  dat checkout    Change view to a given version.\n  dat serve       Start an http server.\n\ndescriptive commands:\n  dat status      Show current status.\n  dat log         List of changes.\n  dat files       List all files.\n  dat datasets    List all datasets.\n  dat forks       List current forks.\n  dat diff        See differences between the data in two forks.\n  dat keys        List existing keys in a dataset.\n\ndata commands:\n  dat import      Add tabular data to a dataset.\n  dat export      View tabular data from a dataset.\n  dat read        Read a binary file.\n  dat write       Write a binary file.\n  dat delete      Delete a key in a dataset.\n  dat merge       Merge two forks into one.\n</code></pre>\n<p>At the time of the Beta release we were most excited about the new decentralized possibilities. We were still unsure about the intuitiveness of the API, but weren‚Äôt sure how to simplify the API without dropping support for use cases we thought were important.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dat-1.0\">Dat 1.0 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#dat-1.0\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We are still working on the official Dat 1.0 release, but you can try out the 1.0 RC (release candidate) today.</p>\n<p>After testing the alpha and beta extensively we realized we had to reduce the scope of Dat in order to make it intuitive to use. One thing we have learned through this process is that the most difficult part of designing software is finding the natural API. Once we know what we want to build actually building it is the easy part.</p>\n<p>In our case we were torn between a tabular data workflow (importing CSVs row by row, re-importing CSVs when individual rows are edited, with key/value database semantics) and a file based workflow (like Dropbox or rsync where we are agnostic to the actual contents and format of the files).</p>\n<p>We decided a &quot;files-first&quot; approach is the way forward. Modeling more complex tabular data workflows on top of Dat is still possible, but we are treating it as an advanced use case. As a result, the new 1.0 command-line API looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ dat link\n# prints share link\n$ dat &lt;share-link&gt;\n# downloads data\n</code></pre>\n<p>We were able to get rid of 90% of our previous API surface area by going lower level (files-first).</p>\n<p>This blog post would be too long if I took the time to list the reasoning behind the removal of all of the commands from the Beta version. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/147914258\">Thankfully, we did a talk about just this redesign late last year</a>, which you can watch below. The short answer is that we decided to try and focus on making something that was as easy to use as Dropbox (but open source and peer to peer), and that specific focus allowed us to streamline quite a bit. As I said above, the hard part was going through the process of trying different approaches until we could feel confident in committing to one of them.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/147914258\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/147914258\">Designing Dat 1.0</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ropensci\">ropensci</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>I hope this was insightful, and please try out the new Dat and let us know what you think!</p>\n",

We‚Äôll even come to your lab to help you get up and running, implement features, and fix bugs in real time.</p>\n<p>Get started and and break things (but don‚Äôt forget to <a href=\"#chat-with-us\">let us know</a> if things break):</p>\n<pre><code>npm install -g dat\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"from-data-sharing-to-a-data-ecosystem\">From Data Sharing to a Data Ecosystem <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#from-data-sharing-to-a-data-ecosystem\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Dat is a data collaboration tool. We think most people will use it to simplify the process of downloading and updating datasets, but we are also very excited about how people will use it to fork, collaborate on, and publish new datasets for others to consume.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve been testing dat with the generous help of physicists, data hackers, machine learning experts, biostatisticians, government developers, sociologists, and informaticians. We brought our work to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKpJgNoT1b8\">Mozilla Science Lab to integrate with Federated Wiki</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKpJgNoT1b8\">the Sanger Institute to show off dat and Bionode</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psmtJUyZHE0\">Berkeley Institute for Data Science where one of us co-works</a>, <a href=\"http://unconf.ropensci.org/\">ROpenSci to talk about visual diffing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM3Pr7tfHF0\">JSConf to get our nerd on</a>, and <a href=\"http://srccon.org/docs/transcripts/datflatsheet/\">to SRCCON to demo with Flatsheet</a>, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>Finally, we‚Äôve landed on an internal and external design that we believe covers the key use cases in the collaboration of data science and open data. With dat beta, you now can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md#31-importing-datasets\">Put multiple data tables in a single repository</a></strong>. With dat alpha, the entire dat was one tabular entity‚Äînow, dat supports complex, heterogeneous datasets composed of different schemas or types of files. Datasets are kind of like SQL tables, except these datasets don‚Äôt support robust querying or joins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md#32-versioning\">Trust versions with cryptographic accuracy</a></strong>. Versions are now represented as uniquely identifiable SHA-256 hashes, and you can attach a message and timestamp for a coarse-grained view of the data‚Äôs history. You can also easily (O(1)) revert to a historical version to view and edit the data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md#34-one-thousand-forks-when-all-you-need-is-a-knife-isnt-irony\">Fork, diff and merge</a></strong>. Although forks could be represented as conflicts to be merged immediately (as one might expect in a version control system such as Git), dat‚Äôs philosophy is the opposite. We think that data tools should embrace forks as key support for experimentation during the scientific process. Now dat is a decentralized, versioned, <a href=\"https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperlog\">directed acyclic graph</a>, so fork away!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deploy over HTTP or SSH. Dat is transport-agnostic and easy to deploy. This means your IT team is happy because your existing authentication schemes will work the same as ever. Feel free to give read-only access through HTTP, too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrate with other backend engines. Now you can use dat on top of any database that implements the <a href=\"https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown\">AbstractLevelDOWN api</a>‚Äîthat means PostgreSQL, Redis, Mongo, Google Drive, etc. This feature is one of the many that still need extensive testing, but we are excited about the prospect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focus on internals</strong>. We‚Äôve decided to scale back our initial offerings of the dat editor and server in favor of relying on a community of modules across languages that are built on top of dat, using dat as a data storage and collaboration tool instead of a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none. Check out <a href=\"http://github.com/flatsheet\">flatsheet</a> for a dat editor replacement and <a href=\"http://github.com/karissa/dat-rest-server\">karissa/dat-rest-server</a> for a REST server replacement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It‚Äôs faster</strong>. Yeah, it‚Äôs faster. And it‚Äôll only get faster as time goes by.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"the-future\">The Future <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-future\">#</a></h3>\n<p>After being granted the security to continue working on dat for the next two years, <a href=\"https://usopendata.org/2015/04/03/sloan/\">courtesy of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>, we are doubling down on reliability on our approach to a full-featured 1.0 release in the coming months. We want to make it easier to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>track forks (with names, for starters);</li>\n<li>verify tabular schemas through test suites, with inspiration from <a href=\"https://github.com/USGS-R/sensorQC\">sensorQC</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/testdat\">testdat</a>;</li>\n<li>add a robust set of complex and heterogenous data security, privacy, and access settings;</li>\n<li>make BitTorrent support easy for fast data transfer (for cases like <a href=\"http://trillianverse.org/\">all of the stars in the sky</a>); and,</li>\n<li>integrate into user-friendly editors like <a href=\"http://flatsheet.io\">flatsheet</a> and <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">the Jupyter Project</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But we can‚Äôt do it without your help (really). Every little piece of feedback counts. We‚Äôre particularly looking for bug testing, feature requests, and integration with existing data sharing systems. We can‚Äôt wait to see your feedback, comments, questions, and pull requests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md\">Read more about the motivation and design of dat‚Äôs new beta</a> in the whitepaper.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chat-with-us\">Chat with Us <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#chat-with-us\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We‚Äôre mostly always available in #dat on <a href=\"https://webchat.freenode.net\">freenode</a>, or <a href=\"https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions\">datproject/discussions on gitter.im</a>, so join us!</p>\n",

Today, after a year of work, we are really excited to release the first major version of dat along with a <a href=\"http://datproject.org\">new website</a>.</p>\n<p>Our overall goal with dat is to make a set of tools for creating and sharing streaming data pipelines, a sort of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\">ETL</a> style system but designed from the ground up to be developer friendly, open source and streaming. We are aligned with the goals of the <a href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/24/frictionless-data-making-it-radically-easier-to-get-stuff-done-with-data/\">frictionless data</a> initiative and see dat as an important tool for sharing data wrangling, munging and clean-up code so that data consumers can simply <code>dat clone</code> to get good data.</p>\n<p>The first six months of dat development were spent making a prototype (thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201346305/\">Knight foundation Prototype Fund</a>). In April of this year we were able to expand the team working on dat from 1 person to 3 persons, thanks to <a href=\"http://usodi.org/2014/04/02/dat\">support from the Sloan foundation</a>. At that time dat also became an official <a href=\"http://usopendata.org/\">US Open Data Institute</a> project, to ensure that open data remains a top priority going forward.</p>\n<p>Sloan‚Äôs proposition was that they like the initial dat prototype but wanted to see scientific data use cases be treated as top priority. As a result we expanded the scope of the project from its tabular-data-specific beginnings and have focused on adding features that will help us work with larger scientific datasets.</p>\n<p>Up until this point, the dat API has been in flux, as we were constantly iterating on it. From this point forward we will be taking backwards compatibility much more seriously, so that third party developers can feel confident building on top of dat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-involved\">How to get involved <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#how-to-get-involved\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#try-it-out\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat#install\">install dat today</a> and play around with it by importing or cloning a dataset.</p>\n<p>You can also click this button to deploy a dat to Heroku for testing purposes for free (but be aware of the <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/readme.md#deploy-to-heroku\">Heroku ephemeral filesystem limitations</a>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bmpvieira/heroku-dat-template.git\"><img src=\"https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png\" alt=\"Deploy\"></a></p>\n<p>The dat REST API comes bundled with the <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat-editor#readme\">dat-editor</a> web application.</p>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat-editor\">\n  <img height=\"200\" title=\"dat editor\" alt=\"dat editor\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxogden/dat-editor/master/screenshot.png\"/>\n</a>\n<p>To start learning about how to use dat please read our <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md\">getting started guide</a>.</p>\n<p>To help you choose an approach to loading data into dat we have created a <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/importing.md\">data importing guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"write-a-module-or-5\">Write a module or 5 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#write-a-module-or-5\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The benefit of dat isn‚Äôt in the dat module, but rather in the ecosystem that it enables to be built around it.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of modules that we think would be really awesome to have, and <a href=\"https://github.com/datproject/discussions/issues/5\">we started a wishlist here</a>.

Now it‚Äôs becoming a US ODI project.</p>\n<p>This is possible because of the second announcement: the <a href=\"http://www.sloan.org/\">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> has provided $260,000 in funding to support the continued development of Dat. That money will be used to pay Max and two additional developers to spend the year growing Dat into a vibrant, healthy, widely used open source project. Sloan‚Äôs interest is in seeing Dat used in the sciences, which produces a great deal of data, but for reasons both cultural and technological, does not generally publish that data openly. We intend to play a role in changing that.</p>\n<p>Max got started yesterday. You can follow along with development of Dat at <a href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat/\">its GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>Our thanks to Josh Greenberg and the Sloan Foundation for their generosity and gracious support. We‚Äôre also grateful to Casey Dachs and the <a href=\"https://www.miamifoundation.org/\">Miami Foundation</a>, and the folks at the Knight Foundation for their important help in making this possible.</p>\n",
